            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And if I am not ſuccesful in my deſigns and endeavours, it is my burden, and I cannot help it. I know that Miniſters may and ought to plant and water, <hi>but 'tis God that giveth the increaſe, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.7.</hi> I know that I am weak, and I know alſo, that the happy ſucceſs of good mens labours, lies not in, or proceeds not from their Abilities, but from the Power of God, and his Spirit working with and by them; or elſe even a great Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> may ſay, <hi>I have laboured in vain,</hi> Iſa. <hi>49.4.</hi> yet I ſay, my Conſcience is my witneſs, that it is my deſire, aim and endeavour to be faithful to Chriſt and you, and to give all diligence to my work and your ſervice; <hi>to Preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, 2 Tim. 4.2.</hi> to feed you with the Bread of <hi>ſound Doctrine, and to give to every one their portion of meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> I know and believe, that the all-ſeeing-eye of my great Lord and Maſter is ſtill on me, and that I muſt ſhortly <hi>give unto him an account of my Stewardſhip;</hi> Luk. <hi>16.2.</hi> how I have performed my work, and diſcharged my Truſt to you: and therefore, I dare not but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be faithful in my Duty to Him and You. Should any of you ſuffer loſs, by any neglect or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs of mine, the ſight and conviction of
<pb facs="tcp:53333:3"/>it would exceedingly afflict me: for I do greatly love you. I would be eminently Inſtrumental in nurſing, educating and building you up in Chriſt, in knowledge, faith, love, peace, joy, holineſs and ſpiritual conſolation, unto eternal life, and am really afflicted that I can do no more towards the attainment of it, and that I am no more ſucceſsful in what I do.</p>
            <p>I hope you have ſome clear proofs and evidences, of what I have ſaid of my ſelf and endeavours, from my practiſes among you. For what other ends can I have in all my labours and ſpendings, but to ſerve Chriſt and your Souls, eſpecially, in and by thoſe that are extraordinary? what ſhould I aim at and deſign in the <hi>Monthly Lecture</hi> to and with you onely; in my <hi>Lords dayes fortnights Lecture,</hi> and in writing this and ſome other books, but your good? you know, that I have ſpent my ſtrength in a more than ordinary manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, regenerate and educate your Families; your Children, Servants, and other Relations of yours. For as I have told you; It was for their ſakes that I ſet it up, and have continued it many years; but how you have eſteemed and encouraged it, and how your Relations have improved it, I leave to all your Conſciences to judge. But however, I have given you a ſufficient proof of my love to you, and care of them, by ſpending my ſtrength and ſpirits with, and for their good: and all unprejudiced perſons cannot but acknowledge it. I could have ſit down (as others do) with Preachi g to you twice every Lords day, and one Lecture in the week-days; had I not ſeen a neceſſity of doing more, and had not my cordial Love to your Souls conſtrained me to the taking of extraordinary pains with you, and for
<pb facs="tcp:53333:4"/>you. My ends and deſigns in the ſaid <hi>Monthly Lecture</hi> were <hi>(1)</hi> To acquaint you with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your duties in the Church, and that every one of you <hi>might know how to behave your ſelves in the houſe of God; 1</hi> Tim. <hi>3.15.</hi> and what duties were or are incumbent on you there. <hi>(2)</hi> To acquaint you with your Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and ſpiritual advantages, that you might value and eſteem them; own and imbrace them; improve and walk worthy of them; and that you might be thankful for them. <hi>(3)</hi> That you might know on what bottom you ſtand in your Church-ſtate, and that you might ſtand there unmovably. <hi>(4)</hi> That you might know your miſcarriages in your Church-ſtate and Relation, and be humbled for; and repent of them in Duſt and Aſhes. <hi>(5)</hi> That you might know the Evils and Temptations you are lyable to in a Church-ſtate, and that you might watch againſt and avoid them. <hi>(6)</hi> That you might be enabled to anſwer <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> and refell their objections. <hi>(7)</hi> That you might look for, and expect all the promiſed good in your Church-ſtate, and endeavour the obtainment of it. <hi>(8)</hi> To quicken and provoke you, to move and perſwade you to all poſſible diligence, care and faithfulneſs, to, and in your own, Jeſus Chriſt's, and one anothers concerns in your Church-ſtate. That you might be pleaſing to God, and profitable to your own and each others Souls in the Ordinances of Chriſt, and in your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion one with another. Theſe were ſome of my ends in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up that Lecture, and which I have with ſome meaſure of ſincerity of heart carried on, though under no ſmall diſcouragements from within and without.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53333:4"/>
            <p>And in purſuance of theſe and other holy ends, I have written ſome of the matters that I preached to you, and have made them ready for your eyes to read and behold them, your judgements and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to judge of them, and for your hearts to receive and embrace them: and that upon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I have done it; as you know.</p>
            <p>They are your matters, and therefore to you, I do dedicate and commend them, becauſe I love you: and if you give me encouragement, <hi>I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſpend, and be ſpent for you, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>12.15.</hi> Brethren, I grudge not at any pains and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, cares and labours, I have taken and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on you or yours: for, I think, that all that I can do for you is too little. I do heartily wiſh, I could be more ſerviceable and profitable to you; and the more you ſhall encourage and ſtrengthen my hands to ſerve you, the better I ſhall do it. I have taken pains to write this Book, or to compoſe, and ſet forth the matters contained in it, as well as I could: had I been able, I ſhould have done it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But however it be done, be you ſure, that the matters diſcourſed of, are of great weight and moment to you. You will find but little in it of man (human frailties excepted) but therefore I hope, you will find the more of God and Goſpel-Truth there. For the Truths of God ſhine forth more gloriouſly, when they appear in their naked native beauty and ſimplicity, than when they come to us cloathed with humane Eloquence, and with the Rhetorical flouriſhes of mens wits. They are ſuch glorious things in their own nature, as that they are never more powerful on, and acceptable to holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts, than when they are repreſented to them pure, clear and entire in their own words and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb facs="tcp:53333:5"/>ſtript of humane Ornaments and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes.</p>
            <p>My deſign was not to commend my ſelf, but the real, the holy, and acceptable will of God: not to ſhew you, what any men think or judge of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to ſhew you, what the Holy Ghoſt thinks and ſpeaks of them. I expect ſevere cenſures from others, (becauſe far better mens works do uſually meet with them) but I hope to meet with none from you, <hi>for love will cover a multitude of weakneſſes</hi> in thoſe, whoſe aim, end and deſign is good in any good work; and you cannot but judge that mine was good in this good undertaking. You put me on the work, and I hope you will find nothing but Truth and plainneſs in it, and cover my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with a mantle of charity; judge that I have performed it as well as I could, for Chriſt's, my own and your ſakes, and conclude, that I have not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, knowingly or careleſly failed in any part of it. Now it is prepared for you, and brought to you by a hand of love, I hope you will take the pains to read and mind it, to underſtand and practiſe the duties contained in it: and although the form of it (as made by me) may not have your eſteem and conſideration, yet do not fail to give the matter of it it's due Reſpects and acknowledgment, let your Head and King, his Truths and wayes, have their dues from you; as alſo your own Souls; and you will greatly gratifie the Authour, who is your real friend.</p>
            <p>In this Book, I have ſhewed you in ſeveral <hi>Chapters (1)</hi> What an inſtituted Goſpel-Church is. <hi>(2)</hi> That particular Congregational Churches are of Divine Inſtitution. <hi>(3)</hi> Of what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials they ſhould be conſtituted and formed.
<pb facs="tcp:53333:5"/>
               <hi>(4)</hi> What is the form of ſuch Churches, or how fit materials ſhould be joyned together, and made a formal houſe. <hi>(5)</hi> The ſeveral Officers of a Church, with their calls, qualifications, works and duties. <hi>(6)</hi> The duties of Church-members to their Officers. <hi>(7)</hi> Their duties to one another. <hi>(8)</hi> Their Church-priviledges and advantages. <hi>(9)</hi> I have ſhewed that all Believers are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bound to joyn themſelves to ſome Goſpel-Church, if they can. <hi>(10)</hi> What the Ordinances are, that God hath given to his Churches. <hi>(11)</hi> How all Church members ought to walk towards God and men, and what Evils and Temptations they are ſubject to, or in danger of. <hi>(12)</hi> I have ſpoken ſomthing of the Lords Supper, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things and matters of great moment, as you will find in your reading of the Book through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: As that Church-members ought not to break off from the Churches, to which they are joyned, but in extraordinary caſes. I have not yet done; but ſhall preſent a few Requeſts to you, for my ſelf, my God, and your own Souls; and which I hope you will not deny me, but freely grant me, becauſe you will find them very reaſonable Requeſts, and ſuch as do nearly concern you and your God, as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> I do earneſtly entreat and beſeech you, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, to do all you can, and are bound in duty to do, to encourage me in my work, ſtrengthen my hands under my weights and burdens, and help me to run my Race, and finiſh my courſe with joy, <hi>1 Cor. 9. Act. 20.24.</hi> and avoid whatever may juſtly diſcourage, tempt and provoke me; or that may weaken my hands, grieve and ſadden my heart,
<pb facs="tcp:53333:6"/>unfit &amp; indiſpoſe me for &amp; in my work &amp; duty with you. For if you do not avoid it, you will tempt and provoke me to ſin, and hinder me in my work and duty.

I can appeal to God, that I ſeek, deſire and endeavour to do you good in whatever I do or propound to have done for, or among you; and therefore, when you neglect to come to the worſhip of God, and keep your place; and when you neglect to ſet forward any good work in the Church for the honour of Chriſt, and the profit of the whole, you do diſcourage me, and tempt me to ſin: and the like you may do, many other wayes; which for brevity ſake, I ſhall not mention. Only this one namely, by your non-proficiency under the means of grace, which will be my great Affliction, becauſe I dearly love you. Your ſerious, conſcientious and conſtant attendance on the adminiſtration of the Ordinances of Chriſt with me; your growing in grace and profiting by them; your readineſs to help and aſſiſt me in promoting and carrying on of good works in the Church, and ſtanding by me in the Lord's work will exceedingly comfort &amp; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me in my Miniſterial work. And pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if it be not your duty, and the will of God you ſhould ſo do. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls, as that they may do it with joy and not with grief: why? why (ſays he) that is unprofitable for you.</p>
            <p>Oh! give me your helping hand, and do not load and burden my work, but endeavour to make my work eaſie, and my life comfortable to the utmoſt of your power.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53333:6"/>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Pray for me,</hi> Heb. <hi>13.18.</hi> and that with all poſſible importunity and conſtancy. For the more you do ſo pray to God for me, the more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he will make my labours to your Souls. Pray for me in your Cloſets, and wreſtle with God for me: for you, (eſpecially) you who walk with God, may do much for me in your Cloſets. I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you in mine; Oh! let me be remembred by you in our Cloſets alſo. For a ſtock of Prayers, of hearty, believing, fervent Prayers, kept a-running one for another, will bring in a great Revenue of grace from Heaven to us. You cannot expect, that I ſhould Preach warmly, profitably and powerfully to you, unleſs you ſo Pray for me. Therefore in obedience to the will of God, and for your own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, do you continue in fervent Prayer unto God for me. Entreat him to pour out much of the Spirit of grace and the grace of the Spirit upon me, fill me with Miniſterial gifts, and <hi>make me an able Miniſter of the New Teſtament.</hi> That God may give me the <hi>door of utterance,</hi> and enable me to <hi>ſpeak, as I ought to ſpeak,</hi> Eph. <hi>6.20.

Pray for me, that I may be kept faithful to Chriſt and you; that I may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and not faint, run and not be weary; that I may be able to bear up under all Burdens and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and be able to overcome and conquer them all; That I may rightly divide the word of Truth, and adminiſter the holy Ordinances of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, ſo, as that he may be magnified,
<pb facs="tcp:53333:7"/>and your Souls profited; That my heart may ſtand clear off the World, and that I may not be taken and entangled with any ſnares, and that I may <hi>perfect holineſs in the fear of God, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>7.1.</hi> and for whatever elſe you may rationally judge, I may ſtand in need of, as your Miniſter.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> I do requeſt you, that if at any time you do certainly ſee, and undoubtedly know any failing or miſcarriage in, or by me, that you will ſpeedily, ſeriouſly, meekly, humbly, and as you ought to do, enform me of it. It is your duty to do ſo; if you do it as you ought, and may do it, I ſhall (through grace aſſiſting) receive it, thank you, and bleſs God for it, and account it my mercy. But I ſhall deſire you, to take heed and beware of theſe three evils towards me in this matter. <hi>(1)</hi> That you do not fancy and make evils or miſcarriages for me, and then charge them on me, as mine; when in truth they are not ſo. It is a very <hi>dangerous thing to condemn the Righteous, and juſtifie the wicked,</hi> as you know, <hi>Prov. 17.15.</hi> and it is moſt dangerous, and abominable in the ſight of the Righteous God to condemn, or falſly to charge his Embaſſadours, becauſe they ſtand in his ſtead, bear his Image of Authority, and do his Miniſterial work in his Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet how common is this evil among Profeſſors, as I can teſtifie? <hi>(2)</hi> Do not take up a Report from others againſt me, and take it for granted, becauſe you hear ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the good wayes of God tell you ſo. For the World, yea, and the Churches alſo are too full of ſlanderous and back biting Tongues. They are not aware of this evil, but hug and embrace it in their boſoms, practiſe it without fear, and commit this abomination with both hands, as the Prophet
<pb facs="tcp:53333:7"/>ſpeaks. Remember that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſtrictly charged you, in <hi>1 Tim. 5.19.</hi> that you do not ſo <hi>much as receive an Accuſation againſt an Elder, under two or three witneſſes;</hi> and that on their certain knowledge of the Fact, not upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and feigned Circumſtances. For God is very curious and tender of their good Names, Credit and Reputations, and he knows, and all wiſe and holy men do know, that they are more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>Envy,</hi> and that they lye more open to the <hi>wrath and hatred</hi> of men, than other men do. Therefore, I ſay, God hath ſet a higher mound about their good Name, for their ſecurity, than about others. <hi>(3)</hi> Do not take up my real or ſuppoſed miſcarriages, and ſpread them before others. Oh! my Brethren, let not this filthy deviliſh wickedneſs be found in you: let not others hear of my faults, before I do my ſelf: be not you <hi>Back-biters and Whiſperers</hi> againſt him, who loves you ſo much, as that he could <hi>ſpend and be ſpent</hi> in the ſervice of your Souls, and who ſeeks your good all he can. Requite not his love to you with ſuch miſchief and wickedneſs againſt him, for the Lord's ſake. You may do him much wrong thereby, but you will much more wrong Chriſt and your own Souls. And let none of you think, that Jeſus Chriſt is an idle Spectator of what you do herein, that he obſerves you not, or that becauſe you imagine you intend him no hurt in what you ſay of him, that therefore he will hold you guiltleſs. No, no: <hi>be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for God will not be mocked: what a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap,</hi> Gal. <hi>6.7.</hi> God doth not ſay, you may ſpeak evil of his Miniſters, or other men, if you intend not to hurt them thereby; no: but he deth expreſly forbid you to back bite, or
<pb facs="tcp:53333:8"/>ſpeak of their evils (though real) at all, behind their backs, until they prove incorrigible, and have rejected your reproofs and endeavours to convince and convert them, <hi>Levit. 19.16, 17. Jam. 4.11. Tit. 3.2. Rom. 1.30, 31. Pſal. 15.3. 2 Cor. 12.20.</hi> But in truth this excuſe or pretence is but a carnal, blind, and diabolical deluſion, to ſhut the eyes of men, and harden their hearts againſt the evils of it, that they may commit it with the more peace and ſatisfaction, that neither men nor their own Conſciences may reprove or controul them, and cry ſhame on them for their ſins, and that they may not be obſtructed, or any way impeded in their doing of that wherein they <hi>find pleaſure.</hi> Neither indeed, can they prove that they do not hate them, or intend their hurt. For it is infallibly certain that they do not really love ſuch, and that they are prejudiced againſt them, and do not in truth ſeek their good. For can I perſwade any reaſonable man by the rules of Reaſon, that I love him, and ſeek his good in the dark (as to him) by doing or ſpeaking that which experience ſhews, will inevitably tend to his hurt, to his ſhame and reproach, and to the alienating of others affections from him. Well then, tell me of my real faults to my face, that I may mend and do ſo no more, for that is the Will of Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 18.15. (4.)</hi> I do requeſt you to <hi>Viſit me,</hi> and let me have your good Company as often as conveniently you can; and when we meet, let our coming together be for the better, and not for the worſe. Surely, I think it is your Duty to give me loving Viſits, as well as I you, and that when you come, you ſhew a readineſs to ſpend our Time, and improve our Viſits to the profit of our Souls, unleſs the meeting be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:53333:8"/>for other buſineſs. The ſtrangeneſs of ſome is no ſmall burden to my ſpirit, and I know not how their Conſciences do diſpence with ſuch Omiſſions. How can we think that ſuch do really Love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who regard not each others Company, nor, though they live near together, will vouchſafe to give them a Viſit in a whole year together? For true Love inclines to Communion, free and open-hearted Society together; and it is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdenſome to true Lovers ſo to do, as that it is their delight. Church-members are bound in duty to give their Teachers friendly Viſits, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in their Works, and to get ſome good from them to their own Souls. They ſhould come and propound Caſes to them, that concern their Faith, Practiſe, Peace, and Comfort, and declare to them their Soul troubles and temptations, and likewiſe their profit and gettings by their Miniſtry. They ſhould open unto them their Soul-wants and Spiritual diſeaſes, that ſo they may know the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to ſuit their Miniſtry to them, and apply words in ſeaſon to their Conviction, Inſtruction, and Comfort. <hi>For the Prieſts Lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and the People ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. <hi>2.7.</hi> Mark it, It is not ſaid that they ſhould always, or moſtly go to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that the People ſhould ſeek to them. Thus the Diſciples came to the Lord Jeſus with their Caſes. And truly Friends, you would greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce my heart, if I might ſee the ſame practiſed by you in a holy and ſerious manner. I do aſſure you, that you ſhould be very welcome to me, and I ſhall moſt freely afford you my help, and give you what aſſiſtance I can. And I do further requeſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb facs="tcp:53333:9"/>you, that when I come to viſit you, that then I may find you ready to entertain me with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable diſcourſe, that may better us in the Inner man; for that is the beſt Entertainment I deſire or expect from you; and it is that which I am ſure will turn to the beſt account now, and at the laſt day. Theſe are ſome of my reaſonable requeſts to you for my ſelf, which I hope you will not deny me.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. I have a few requeſts to you for God, and your Head and King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. (1.)</hi> That you would ſtill remember how you <hi>have received him,</hi> as your Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and ſo walk ye in him,</hi> Col. <hi>2.6.</hi> Examine the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſtand upon, and take not up with <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Regeneration</hi> and real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt by Faith. It is to be feared that too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church-members ſit down ſhort of Chriſt, a new State, and a thorow change of heart; that they content themſelves with their being in the Churches of Chriſt, the uſe of Ordinances, and with their Church-priviledges. We read of <hi>five Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in fellowſhip with five Wiſe Virgins;</hi> and we read of <hi>bad Fiſhes</hi> in the Nets with the good; of <hi>Tares</hi> growing amongſt the good <hi>Wheat;</hi> and of <hi>Hypocrits in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (the Churches) which Chriſt ſhall <hi>gather out</hi> and caſt into the fire, <hi>Matth. 25.2. Matth. 13.47, 48, 49, 50. Iſa. 33.14.</hi> Take good heed that none of you be ſuch: You have paſt the <hi>Teſt</hi> of mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they take you for true Saints in their Char table judgments; but you may be notorious Hypocrites for all that, and you muſt paſs under the Infallible Tryal and Judgment of God too, who can and will make a true Judgment of you. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:53333:9"/>do you endeavour to know your own States by ſerious and diligent ſearch, <hi>2 Cor. 13.5. 2 Pet. 1.10.</hi> You may be Members of a true Church of Chriſt, and yet not be true Members of Chriſt; you may be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to his People in Church-fellowſhip, whilſt you are Strangers to Chriſt. And know, that if you are Hypocrites in the Churches, you are an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to him; you defile his holy Temple, and his Soul abhors you.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, if upon your ſerious tryal of your ſelves, you find indeed, that you are new Creatures, and have really received Chriſt the Lord on his own terms, then do you <hi>walk in him, and worthy of him,</hi> Col. <hi>1.10.</hi> Own him, Truſt him, Love him, Obey him, Subject and Live to him, as to your Head, Lord, and King. Receive, and walk by his Laws and Rules only, and give him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of his Headſhip, and Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, in, and by your ſo doing, <hi>Luk. 6.46.</hi> Remember that you are the Servants of Chriſt, <hi>bought with a price,</hi> even the price of Chriſt's Blood, that you ſhould be his Servants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; therefore <hi>be you not the Servants of men,</hi> in his matters and concernments, <hi>1 Cor. 7.23. (2.)</hi> Do you ſtand up, and be Zealous for, and in the cauſe of your Lord and King, <hi>Rev. 3.19.</hi> You are redeemed to it, <hi>Tit. 2.14.</hi> and your Head expects it from you. Keep your hearts with him and for him, and ſuffer no Stranger, no Luſt, Self, or any Creature to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp and Poſſeſs his Throne in you. Shew your Zeal againſt all Intruders, and fight them off when ever they aſſault you, or attempt to get poſſeſſion of your hearts. Be you Zealous for, and in his pure Goſpel-worſhip and Ordinances; for, and in upholding, ſanctifying and celebrating
<pb facs="tcp:53333:10"/>of them in the Church. <hi>(3.)</hi> Encourage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of Chriſt in each others hearts, and to enrich one another with the Truths and Grace of Chriſt as much as you can; for it is your duty ſo to do, and you will thereby pleaſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, <hi>1 Theſ. 5.11. Jude 20.</hi> You ſhould labour to augment, encreaſe, and nouriſh the Graces, Comforts, and Experiences; provoke, ſtrengthen, and ſtir up one another to Love, Truſt, Fear, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Serve Chriſt more and better, <hi>For this is the Will of God concerning you, 1 Theſ. 5.18. (4.)</hi> Honour Chriſt by reproving your ſinning-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and endeavouring all you can to hide it from the knowledge of others, and to <hi>reſtore them with a ſpirit of meekneſs, not ſuffering ſin to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> Gal. <hi>6.1.</hi> Lev. <hi>19.17.</hi> Lift them out of the ditch of Sin, whereinto Temptation hath caſt them, and that with all poſſible ſecrecy and privacy for the honour of Chriſt and your Brethren, and for the good of their Souls who have ſinned. Sin (eſpecially in Church-members) carries Reproach in its mouth, on Chriſt, his Ways and Temples; and therefore by the ſame Argument and Reaſon, and for the ſelf-ſame cauſe, that we are to honour Chriſt, and prevent all Reproach to his Name, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and People, we ſhould hide each others ſins as long as poſſible, and there is hope; and endeavour privately to heal offences, and cure the Offenders. <hi>(5.)</hi> Labour to <hi>ſhine as Lights in all manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſs, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3.11.</hi> Declare whoſe you are, and what you are, to all men, by your fruits of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth. 5.16. Phil. 2.15, 16.</hi> O remember that you are the <hi>Living Witneſſes</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt in the World, <hi>Iſa. 43.10, 12. Iſa. 44.8, 9. Rev. 11.3.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53333:10"/>and therefore you ſhould endeavour all you can, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively and poſitively, by words, deeds, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, to make full proof of, and give in your good Teſtimony to the holy Name, and to the Excellency of the Grace and good ways of Jeſus Chriſt. The Churches of Chriſt in the World, are as <hi>Beacons</hi> ſet on Hills, which attract and draw the eyes of all men to them. They watch for your halting, and are very curious in marking your ſteps; and that will be made a fault in you, which is not in others, <hi>Pſal. 27.11, 12.</hi> Therefore you muſt be a ſingular People before all men, and ſo walk as to ſhame your Enemies, and that they may have no evil thing (justly) to ſay of you, <hi>1 Pet. 3.16.</hi> And you muſt not only be good negative Profeſſors and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, but you muſt alſo ſhine and be fruitful in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work, and in gracious words and carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. You ſhould be excellent living Witneſſes to Chriſt and his ways, by ſhining in Humility, Meekneſs, Temperance, Love, Charity, Kindneſs, Self-denyal, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, in Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Gravity, in Sweetneſs and Affability, and in all Holineſs, Heavenly-mindedneſs, Zeal, and Spirituality; in Goodneſs, Peaceableneſs, or in what-ever Grace or Virtue may adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Theſe are ſome of the things I do requeſt of you for God and your King. As likewiſe that you lay to heart his Love and Grace to you, and endeavour to affect your hearts with them, ſtir them up to all cordial thankfulneſs, and oblige them to live and love forth praiſes to his holy Name. Remember, that you are under Electing, Redeeming, Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, Quickening, Teaching and Comforting Love and Grace; and that you are entruſted with,
<pb facs="tcp:53333:11"/>and have the enjoyments of many glorious priviledges in your hands, for the filling you with all the fulneſs of Chriſt, and nouriſhing you up unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life in your Church-ſtate, <hi>Joh. 1.16. Eph. 4.11, 16. Pſal. 92 Pſal. 132. I have ſome Requeſts to you for, and in the behalf of your own Souls.</hi> Indeed all the other things deſired of you already, have reſpect and relation unto the good and profit of your own Souls, as well as to my good and God's Glory. But that which I ſhall now deſire of you, reſpects your Soul directly and immediately; and therefore I hope you will eaſily and readily grant them for your own ſakes; although Jeſus Chriſt, and my ſelf are concerned in them alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Endeavour to profit by your means and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and to grow in all Grace in your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and enjoyments therein. Do not reſt ſatisfied with your Church-ſtate and Priviledges, but make ſerious enquiry after your gettings; and what good, what ſpiritual profit you find in them, make uſe of them all to the gracious and holy ends for which they are given to you. Namely, to Teach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you; to Feed and Nouriſh you; to Arm and Strengthen you; to Comfort and Refreſh you; to Confine and Eſtabliſh you in the Faith of Chriſt; to Purge and Sanctifie you; to Confirm and Seal you up unto the day of Redemption, and to convey the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt into your hearts. To acquaint you with your ſelves, and enable you to know and diſcern the worſt and beſt of your ſelves; what God hath done for you, &amp; what ſin, the world, and Devil have done againſt you. To acquaint you with Jeſus Chriſt, his Love, Grace, Truth, Providences, and Benefits, and to bring him into your Hearts, and into Fellowſhip and Communion
<pb facs="tcp:53333:11"/>with you. Therefore look after theſe Ends, and other of like Import, and ſee that you do indeed and in Truth proſecute and obtain them, and take not up ſhort of them. Oh! be you ſure to mind your Earnings in all your Enjoyments, and God's Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Take hold of ſuch Counſels, Reproofs and Inſtructions, as your Brethren ſhall give you in time of need, to prevent your Sinning, or to reduce and turn you back from Sin to Duty. O remember, that it is a choice means, and one of God's Holy Ordinances to do you good: yea, to do you a great deal of good, and an unexpreſſible Pleaſure. And therefore, if you love your Souls, turn not a deaf Ear to them; ſlight them not, nor harden your Hearts againſt them. But hearken to, and cloſe up with them: Embrace them as choice Mercies to you; bleſs God exceedingly for them, and love and thank your Counſellors, and Reprovers heartily. For it is an invaluable mercy, to have ſuch true Friends at hand; who will expreſs ſo much love to, and care of us, as that when they ſee us in danger of falling, ſhall give us their preventing ſuccouring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to ſupport and hold us up; or when they ſee us fall and need their help, they ſhall not <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> Gen. <hi>9.22.</hi> go and tell others of it, but ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably give us their hands, to help us up again. Oh! be not angry with them, but love and thank them, and take, receive and reverence their Voice, as the Voice of God. And know, that if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſlight it, or are diſpleaſed with them for their Work and Labour of Love to you; you do thereby reject and ſlight the Voice of God, and are diſpleaſed at his Merciful diſpenſation to you for your good. <hi>For your Inſtructors and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
<pb facs="tcp:53333:12"/>were ſent to you by God himſelf;</hi> and it was he that inclined their Hearts to go, and opened their Mouths to ſpeak to you, and do for you ſo great an office of Love. Therefore, be you of that wiſe ſort of Men, who will hear Reproof from their Friends. <hi>Prov. 1.5. Prov. 9.8, 9. Prov. 10.8. Prov. 12.15. Prov. 25.12. and own it as the Voice of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Be careful that you ſtay not, or take up in Ordinances, but go to, and have your eye on Chriſt in them. We are exceeding apt to ſtick faſt in the way of coming to God, and to ſit down ſhort of the end; of the God and grace of the means; and without great heedfulneſs and circumſpection in this matter, we may eaſily run our ſelves deep in ſin; and thereby wrong our Souls, as alſo by the want of the God and grace of the means. Mind that Text in <hi>Eſa. 64.5. Thou meeteſt him that remembers thee in thy wayes;</hi> namely, ſuch as ſeek God in his wayes, and paſs thorow them, unto himſelf. But obſerve, that by ſticking in, and taking up with Ordinances you greatly ſin againſt God, by making a God of Ordinances; ſetting up his Creatures in his place and Throne, giving unto them his Honour and Glory, and robbing him of his due. <hi>You neglect the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hew out to your ſelves broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, that can hold no water:</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt calls <hi>two evils,</hi> Jer. <hi>2.13.</hi> You will thereby grieve the Holy Spirit, cauſe him to with-draw from you, and withold the bleſſings and good of his Ordinances from your Souls. Oh! my Brethren, little do many of you think how deep you are under the guilt of this ſin, and what a Controverſie God hath with your Souls for it; and little do you think
<pb facs="tcp:53333:12"/>what loſers and ſufferers you are thereby. Little do many think how often they are caught in this ſnare, and how exceedingly offenſive it is to God, and detrimental to their own Souls. Wonder not that Ordinances profit you not, and that God is not with you in them; if you ſtick in, and take up with them. In love I give you warning of it, that you may conſider it, watch and pray againſt it; that you may carefully mind and do what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in his Worſhip and Ordinances; namely, that you go to, and ſeek him in them indeed. And remember, that it is your Duty, that you muſt; and your Priviledge, that you may go to, and find him and his Grace in them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>(4.)</hi> Live by faith in all your wayes, and make uſe of all God's Ordinances in Faith and Hope. For it is faith in Chriſt, and on the Covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that will keep you ſteady and unmovable: <hi>that will hold your Souls in Life, and with joy draw water out of the Wells of Salvation,</hi> Eſa. <hi>12.3.</hi> Rom. <hi>15.13.</hi> It is faith and hope that will unite your hearts to Chriſt and his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and encourage you in your doing and ſuffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, <hi>Rom. 5.5. 1 Joh. 3.3.</hi> unbelief holds off, and keeps back mercies from you; but faith and hope draws them to you. You cannot ſee God in his Worſhip and Ordinances, but by Faith; neither can you ſee the beauty, and glorious Excellency of the Promiſes, Goſpel-Ordinances, and Goſpel-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and obedience to them, but by Faith. You can get no good, no encouragement in the Goſpel, and wayes of God, but by faith and hope. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore live by Faith and in a well-grounded hope.</p>

Now this he doth, 1. By fitting and preparing materials: It is not the work of men or Angels to make men fit matter for a Church or Temple of God, but it is the work of the omnipotent Spirit. It is his work, and in the power of his hand only to quicken the dead, to enlighten the blind; to tranſlate men out of the kingdom of Satan, and bring them into Chriſt's. 2.

By ſtirring up his Miniſters hearts and tongues to move and perſwade them to it. 4thly.

God doth not ſet up Churches to ſtand empty and Idle, only to have a name and to be gazed on; but he hath inſtituted, appointed and erected them for his Name, Honour and Glory in the world, and for the Soul-profit and benefit of his people: that they ſhould walk with him, and He with them: that they ſhould obey and honour him, and he ſupply and enrich them with his grace; and for other glorious ends and purpoſes which ſhall be diſcourſed of, the Lord aſſiſting.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A true Inſtituted Goſpel-Church is, a Society or Congregation of perſons called out of the world, or their ſtate of death, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unbelief, by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt; to the knowledge of Chriſt and his will, and unto the Obedience of faith: or, A company of Believers united together in a holy Band, by ſpecial and voluntary agreement; who by the grace and power of Chriſt in their hearts under the conviction of their duty, do <hi>give</hi> up <hi>themſelves to the Lord, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the will of God;</hi> to live and walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Saints, in love, peace, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53333:20"/>celebration and practice of all the Laws and worſhip of Chriſt; and in the obſervation of all his Goſpel-Ordinances, in Obedience to his Holy Will, for his Glory and their own Spiritual profit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>This Church, ſo united and built, is called a Church, a Houſe, a Temple, Habitation of God and Jeſus Chriſt; and they own it as their own, call it by their own Names, and confirm it with their Preſence in it. And as ſuch a Church, it is the proper ſeat and ſubject of all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-worſhip and ordinances of Chriſt in the world, as will appear in the other Chapters; and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt on it here. Onely take theſe ſew hints of this Church, along with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an Inſtituted Church of Jeſus Chriſt; namely a Church of his own appointment and erection; of his own making, and forming, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own will and pleaſure, by his own Authority and Approbation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The materials or perſons conſtituting this Church are ſaid to be holy perſons, called out of their old worldly ſtate of death, blindneſs and unbelief, unto the knowledg (that is, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledg) of Chriſt and his will, and unto the Obedience of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Inſtruments that call them and work them for this ſtate; and that is the Word and Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The form of this Church; namely their own free, ſpecial and voluntary agreement
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53333:20"/>among themſelves, giving themſelves to the Lord (before each other) and then to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the will of God: entering into a holy band or Engagement, to live and walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (through divine aſſiſtance) in Love, peace, and in the celebration and practice of all the Laws, worſhip and ordinances of Chriſt in the Church; in obedience to his holy Will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ends of their ſo doing, namely, the Glory of Chriſt and their own ſpiritual profit. Theſe are ſome of the chiefeſt things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this definition of an Inſtituted Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church: All which I ſhall (through God's help) prove and demonſtrate hereafter, under ſeveral heads.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Of what Extent ſhould an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Goſpel-Church be; or, how many perſons ſhould it conſiſt of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſhould be formed of ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as may capacitate them to perform all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary-Church Acts, in purſuance of Chriſt's Laws and Rules, by which the Society ought to walk: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. and of no more than may conveniently meet together in one place, for the celebration of all Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the Edification of the whole Church. Now, How many perſons (preciſely) are requiſite to make and conſtitute ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Church, I cannot determine: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, there ought to be ſuch a number, as may orderly and regularly deal with and proceed againſt a delinquent-member, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Rule in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. And as the Church ſhould conſiſt of ſo many, ſo it ſhould have no more perſons in it, then (as was ſaid) may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53333:21"/>comfortably and conveniently meet or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together for the worſhip of God, and profit of the whole Church, in one place: and that (1.) becauſe they are one congregation by their own conſent and agreement, and ſo ought not to devide and ſeparate themſelves one from another in the worſhip and ordinances of God, but there (at the ſame times) <hi>with one heart and one mouth, glorify God, Rom.</hi> 15.6. (2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Church is bound at all times (excepting extraordinary caſes) to wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the adminiſtration of their own Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by virtue of Chriſts Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. enjoyning them ſo to do, and alſo by virtue of their own engagement and relation they ſtand in to them. (3) For their own comfort and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in the Church and ordinances of God. This is one of the great ends of Churches, and the worſhip and ordinances of God there, namely, the profit and edification of all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3, 31. But how can it be, unleſs they can all hear, and joyn one with another, in the ordinances? (4) Becauſe a Church ought to obſerve ordinances, and worſhip God as a Church, and not as, or under the notion of ſingle and individual Believers; but, as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Body and ſociety they muſt all at once, and in the ſame numerical duties and ordinances, in one place, joyn together as with one Heart, Mouth, Mind and Judgment; deſigning, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at, and carrying on the ſame holy Ends in all the worſhip of God. Therefore a Church of Chriſt may not exceed ſuch a number of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as may conveniently meet altogether in one place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. But I ſhall not enlarge on this head.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are appointed and Inſtituted of God, by Jeſus Chriſt: which will appear in or by theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scripture tells us, that the Spirit is the <hi>former and builder</hi> of them. The <hi>Text</hi> is clear for it, <hi>in whom you alſo are builded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for an habitation of God, through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, verſ.</hi> 22. Theſe are the words of Chriſt (by <hi>Paul</hi>) unto the particular congregational Church of the believing <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as is clear in the 20 Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 27, 28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. Where the Lord Jeſus calls them a diſtinct Houſhold, Church or Body of Saints, gathered or joyned together in his name, for his glory, the celebration of his worſhip, ordinances and appointments: I ſay, Chriſt ſtiles them a Church, and ſpeaks to them as a Church and diſtinct Body or houſe of Saints, from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons or Churches whatſoever: and this Church was not formed and built by man, but by the will, power, light and direction of the holy Ghoſt; &amp; therefore the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church of Epheſus, is called the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and the <hi>Church of the living God</hi> in the ſame verſ. and the diſtinct particular Churches, are called the <hi>Churches of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53333:22"/>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. and the <hi>Churches of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And the <hi>Lord added to the</hi> particular <hi>Church at Jeruſalem, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved: Act.</hi> 2. <hi>vlt.</hi> The holy Spirit by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and with the conſent and Authority of God the Father and Chriſt his Son, <hi>who is alſo God bleſſed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9.5. prepares mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for a Church, and then he joyns them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and makes them a holy and glorious Temple or Church of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.27. So that we have enough to confirm this Truth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that particular Churches of Believers are of God, in this one particular, namely, Becauſe God himſelf is the former and builder of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It further appears by the <hi>Lord's owning of them, promiſing and vouchſafing his preſence with them:</hi> which he would never do if they were not of his Inſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But now the Lord declares his owning of, and promiſes his preſence and abode with them, as his Churches. Jeſus Chriſt doth not only (by his Spirit) prepare and fit men for this ſtate, build them up and ſtamp his own and his Father's name upon them; but alſo he <hi>dwells in them,</hi> and makes them his <hi>walks, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces and places of his delight: Here</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will I dwell, for I have deſired it; Pſal.</hi> 135.14. yea theſe Churches are his choſen and moſt pleaſant habitations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13. <hi>where he reſts, and repoſes himſelf, v,</hi> 14. and that for ever: not, to look on or viſit them now and then, but to reſt himſelf, and dwell there for ever: not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53333:22"/>for a few days, but for ever. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. the Lord Jeſus tells the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that <hi>he walked in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks;</hi> which were the ſeven diſtinct, particular, and congregational Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. and in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. (ſays he) <hi>I will dwell in them and walk in them:</hi> that is, in the particular Church at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Now, particular congregational Churches are of God, or Men, but they cannot be of mens deviſing and ſetting up, becauſe God owns them and confirms them with his preſence; deſires, and chuſes them for his Reſt, and dwells in them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with delight and complacency; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be of God: for, the great and holy God will not own the devices of men in and about his name and worſhip, but abhorrs and loaths them, condemns and rejects them as filthy and abominable things, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. and much leſs will he delight and reſt in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That particular congregational-Churches of Believers are of divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is further evinced and confirmed, <hi>by the conſtant and univerſal practice of Believers in the Apoſtles daies:</hi> for, no ſooner were any Jews or Gentiles converted to Chriſt, but aſſoon as they had opportunity, they joyned to, or congregated into, Churches. So <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. it is ſaid, that <hi>they were daily added to the Church, verſ,</hi> 47. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the places where the Apoſtles preached amongſt the Jews and Gentiles, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was received, that aſſoon as a number were converted, they congregated, as being the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53333:23"/>firſt work they were to do after they had <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt Jeſus the Lord. Col.</hi> 2.6. and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were called Churches of Chriſt and Temples of God; a multitude of them you read of in the <hi>Acts, Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And what they did therein, was by the doctrine and advice of the Apoſtles, and according to what they taught them, from and in the name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Now, what they did and practiſed by Apoſtolical direction, and with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, hath the binding force and power of a divine precept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. It was the univerſal practice of the primitive Saints, to joyn themſelves to ſome Church of Chriſt; inſomuch, that we can hardly find any one of them continuing out of a Church-ſtate any time, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. We ſeldome read (in divine hiſtories) of any believers, but what had relation to one Church or other, planted and watered by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. By which ſaid univerſal practice we may conclude, that particular Churches of Believers are of Gods owne Inſtitution. For the Saints of God durſt not do then, as many dare do now, namely, to live in the willful neglect of ſo great a Duty and priviledg; the love and fear of God, and the will of Chriſt, eaſily perſwaded them to give up themſelves unto Chriſt in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience unto his whole revealed will. And they could not congregate and joyn into Churches, nor abide and worſhip God in them in faith and obedience unleſs they had known that what they did therein, was the will of Chriſt, and their duty.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53333:23"/>
               <p>Fourthly, This Truth is further confirmed, <hi>by the Laws, Rules, and Orders, that Jeſus Chriſt hath given to his Churches, as Churches, and not as to individual and ſingle Believers.</hi> Almoſt all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> are written for, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Believers as inchurched and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into bodies and diſtinct congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and he directs his Epiſtles to them under the ſtile and Title of Churches, <hi>To the Church of God which is at Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>To the Church of the Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.1. In which Epiſtles, are all the Laws, Rules and Orders, for all the members of the Churches walking and practice, contained: (which ſhall be afterwards opened, when I come to ſpeak of the duties of Churches) and the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> are written and ſent to him, to direct him <hi>how to behave himſelf in the Houſe of God,</hi> and to ſhew him what his work and duty was in the Church: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 14, 15. So other Epiſtles are given to the Churches, that they might know how to behave themſelves in that ſtate and Relation. There are Rules and Laws for their faith and Love, and orders for their walkings and practices. There they are Inſtructed and taught how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt their Head and Ruler, towards their <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> and towards one another as fellow-Members. There they have laid down their particular works and duties towards God and Men, and ſhewed how they ſhould perform them; as alſo, motives and encouragements to move and quicken them to diligence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the practice of them. And although
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53333:24"/>all ſorts of duties are there laid down and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, namely, ſuch as reſpect other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Capacities, as of husband and wife, parents and children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the chief and great end, matter and ſcope of them, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them as Believers in a Church-ſtate and Relation, as will further appear when I come to ſpeak of the ſpecial and particular duties of Church Members, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now then, if God hath given his Laws, Rules and Orders unto Churches, or to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as in a Church ſtate and condition, for their holy and regular walking towards God and one another, as in that relation; then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, particular congregated Churches of Believers are of God, and of divine Inſtitution: For ſurely the holy and jealous God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo far own and priviledge the devices and Inſtitutions of men in matters that ſo nearly concern his worſhip and Glory, as to dignify them with his holy Laws and Ordinances; as he hath done to his own Churches, that are of his own Inſtitution and appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Truth is further ratifyed and confirmed, <hi>by the Officers he hath given to them, for their well-being, ordering and managing of Church-affairs and concernments, in his name, for his glory and their profit.</hi> Theſe <hi>Officers</hi> are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and enumerated in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and elſewhere; as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are not given by men, but, God: authorized &amp; impowred by him to act and officiate as ſuch in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet them in</hi> his Church. And <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. (ſays
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53333:24"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to the Elders of the Church at <hi>Epheſus;) Take heed to your ſelves and to the Church over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ad paſcendam Eccleſiam Dei, <hi>to feed the Church of God:</hi> And in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>he</hi> (that is, Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.) <hi>gave Paſtors and Teachers, for the work of the Miniſtry, verſ.</hi> 11. And as they are given, authorized and ſent of God, or ſet by him in the Churches; ſo he hath allotted and appointed them their ſeveral diſtinct works and buſineſſes there, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to take heed and ſee they do it, as he appoints: <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and takes ſpecial care about their qualifications for their work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. yea, he gives and beſtows Gifts and abilities, himſelf, on them, for the Churches ſakes, that they may be <hi>able miniſters of the New-Teſtament; not of the letter</hi> only, but of the Spirit; and promiſes to be with them, himſelf, in all their endeavours, to diſcharge their Truſt, and perform their works, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>vlt.</hi> and will bleſs and proſper their labours to his Glory and the Churches benefit.</p>
               <p>Now aſſuredly, God would never have made ſuch proviſions, for Churches of humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſetting up: he would never ſo far own the works of mens hands, without his mind, Authority &amp; appointment; and therefore ſeeing God hath provided and ſet Officers in them, appointed them their works, qualified &amp; fitted them by his Spirit; &amp; promiſed to be with them; particular Churches of Believers, muſt be of divine Inſtitution: of God, &amp; not of men.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53333:25"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This further appears, <hi>by the order and diſcipline Chriſt hath appointed, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be obſerved and practiſed in his Churches.</hi> He hath appointed and given Officers unto them (as before-ſaid), and to them hath he committed the uſe, exerciſe and power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> to open and ſhut his door; to execute his Laws, and to manage his concernments and houſhold-affairs therein: namely, in his Name, and by the Authority he hath given them for that end and purpoſe; and he hath charged the Churches to <hi>Obey and ſubmit themſelves to them in the Lord,</hi> in the exerciſing of their power and Authority in his name, to his Glory and the Churches profit, according to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. Theſe Officers or Elders, have the power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt in their hands, to correct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, to inſtruct, admoniſh and reprove; and, in caſe of obſtinacy, to caſt them out, or remove them from their memberſhip in the Churches, (which the Churche's ſuffrage) and upon Repentance to receive them in again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5.7, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. The neglect of which, Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> for, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 20. And as the Churches have, by their Elders, the orders and diſcipline of Chriſt, with power and Authority to uſe and exerciſe the ſame; ſo, each particular Church hath power to chuſe and appoint Officers for themſelves, namely, ſuch as they judge the Lord Jeſus hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fitted for them: ſuch as he offers and preſents to them and gives a place and intereſt in their hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53333:25"/>
                  <hi>Quumque ipis per ſusfragia creaſſent per ſingulas Eccleſias (Beza);</hi> a Church may Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do that which Believers cannot ſo do in a ſingle and individual capacity, as Believers; but they may as a congregated Body, and as an incorporated ſociety, who have voluntarily given up themſelves, and engaged to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by the Will of God,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, &amp; walk together by the ſame Laws and Rules of the Society or Corporation: Theſe have not ſingly, but joyntly as a Corporation, the power and exerciſe of diſcipline. <hi>When ye are come together, deliver ſuch a one to Satan, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4. <hi>and if he will not hear thee, tell it to the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 16. So then if Chriſt hath given Rules, laws and power of order and diſcipline to particular congregated Churches of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, then they are of divine Inſtitution. And indeed ſpiritual diſcipline cannot elſewhere be rightly exerciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This Truth is further confirmed, <hi>by their names and honourable Titles.</hi> God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt his Son, calls them by their own names, and ſo owns them for their own Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God; If any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. And as Jeſus Chriſt honours them with the high ſtile and Title of his holy Temple, ſo alſo his <hi>Habitation, Eph.</hi> 2.22. and his <hi>Houſhold, Eph.</hi> 2.19. as alſo the <hi>Houſhold of Faith, Gal.</hi> 6.10. And further he intitles
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53333:26"/>them his Churches, or <hi>the Churches of God, and Chriſt, and golden Candleſticks: Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. And that in alluſion to the old Temple, and Candleſticks thereof, which were of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Moreover a particular congregated Church of Believers, is called the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. and Chriſt his <hi>Walks, Rev.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p>Theſe were particular Congregational Churches that he thus owns, and honours with ſuch Titles; <hi>(viz)</hi> the particular Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Corinthians, Theſſalonians.</hi>

                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> Believers as inchurched or incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roted Bodies, <hi>are ſpoken to by name,</hi> the great diſ overies made of Gods purpoſes and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded works in the latter daies, are directed and given to them by the Spirit. Hence it is often ſaid in the <hi>Revelations; he that hath an Ear let him hear, what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches;</hi> which were diſtinct incorporated Bodies and Societies of Believers, <hi>Rev</hi> 2.7, 17, 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.6, 13, 22.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt reveals to them, the <hi>rice, name, nature, and works of Antichriſt;</hi> what he ſhould be, and what he ſhould do; from whence he ſhould come, what he ſhould do to the Churches, Temple and beloved City of God, and what his end ſhould be. There he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and Church-ſtate of Gods People, and what he would do with and for them. There they are ſhewed largely and abundantly, the care and Love of Chriſt to his People, of the warr and conflicts that ſhall be between the Dragon, Beaſts, Whore, falſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53333:26"/>Prophet; and Jeſus Chriſt and his followers; as alſo the Iſſue of all: as you may find in that book of the Revelations. All which ſhews, that particular Churches of Believers are of God. For the Holy Spirit would never own the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men ſo farr as to make known to them ſuch great things, as he there declares unto the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> If particular congregational Churches had not been of divine Inſtitution, but of mens deviſing; <hi>then ſurely Jeſus Chriſt and the Holy Spirit would have ſharply reproved them for their ſetting up their poſts by God poſts,</hi> as he did the Jews, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8. and as he reproved them for their miſcarriages in their Church-ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galatians, &amp;c.</hi> But we never find them reproved or found fault withal for their being inchurched and incorporated into diſtinct congregations, but they are often Commended for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. For men to ſet up Churches, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Houſes, to be the ſeats and ſubjects of Gods Ordinances and Worſhip, and then to entile the name &amp; Authority of Jeſus Chriſt to them, had been a moſt high and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wickedneſs indeed, and ſuch as he would never have wincked at, but abhorred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them, as mens works. Therefore particular congregated Churches of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are of God; for if they had not, he would undoubted have ſeverely reproved them for their ſo walking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Theſe congregational Churches muſt needs be of God; <hi>becauſe without ſuch, the worſhip and ordinances of God cannot regularly &amp; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53333:27"/>be obſerved and performed by men, in a ſolemn, fixed and publique ſtated way and manner;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the paſtors &amp; overſeers of them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably perform their work, and adminiſter the ordinances of Chriſt to men. For all that are priviledged with Chriſt his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,</hi> and profeſs to own him for their Lord and Saviour, ought to live under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline, and to ſubject themſelves to all the orders and Appointments of Chriſt, and to own and give up themſelves to the guidance and Rule of ſuch as he hath ſet over them; and their Teachers and Elders are to take care of, watch over and duely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſuch as Chriſt hath committed to their care, inſpection and charge: Now how can they do it unleſs they are fixed, formed and known Churches or Congregations: unleſs they have mutually choſen each either to walk together in their ſeveral places and capacities as a ſtated Church or Family of God? How can they be overſeers of Churches, and take care of them as ſuch, as Chriſt commands them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. unleſs they are firſt Churches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be ſuch unto their Guides, that they may take the care and charge of, and adminiſter to them as Churches of Chriſt? If their officers are ſtated, fixed officers to them, then they muſt be ſtated, fixed Churches to their officers. How elſe ſhall they know who are their flocks, their care and charge, and who are not? who they are bound to over-ſee and miniſter too, as their own peculiar flocks? what they are to do, give or receive, to or from them? or how to diſcharge their miniſterial
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53333:27"/>work unto them, and give an account of them unto their Lord and Maſter; unleſs they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Societys, who have engaged to walk together as Churches, in all Chriſts-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and choſen them to adminiſter to them in the name of Chriſt, and by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And how can they adminiſter Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances unto them as Church-Officers unleſs they are, and they own and approve of them as the Churches of Chriſt; and believe that they are ſet there by Chriſt, as Church-Officers, to officiate for him as ſuch, to his Churches as Churches? what Authority can they claim over them, unleſs with their own mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they acknowledge and own each other as Churches and Officers of Chriſt, to and in them? How can they adminiſter the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to them, authoritatively, require their attendance on their adminiſtrations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their neglects: and how can their <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> preach to them <hi>with all Authority:</hi> How can they watch over and feed them and expect their Love, Duty, and Subjection, and how can they exerciſe the power of the Keys, and adminiſter cenſures, to and amongſt them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are related to one another as Officers and Churches? Miniſters are <hi>charged to take care of their own flocks, Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. and to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves</hi> ſo and ſo in <hi>the Houſe of God</hi> committed to their Truſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 15. and ſuch are pronounced Bleſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Who then</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>is a Faithful and Wiſe Steward, or Servant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them meat in due Seaſon?

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53333:28"/>Theſe are ſome of the many Reaſons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that might be given, to ſhew that particular congregated Churches of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are of God and not of men.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53333:28"/>
                  <hi>to be Saints,</hi> and have really and ſincerely taken upon them the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus. I ſay ſuch perſons, and only ſuch, doth Jeſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count meet to be partakers of this priviledge and dignity, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and to make <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Places, Eph.</hi> 1.3. although men do not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know them to be ſuch, and by reaſon of their darkneſſe and fallable Judgments, they may receive and admit others into Churches, and unto their priviledges and immunities; yet in truth they have no right unto them, and ought not to be there. For theſe Spiritual-Holy things are for, and only for Spiritual and Holy Men; Heavenly places are for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Perſons, and Spiritual works for Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Men. Now the Churches of Chriſt are the only Holy, Spiritual and Heavenly places, and the Seats and Subjects of Holy and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. Chriſt prepares men by his Grace, Word and Spirit, to make them fit and meet materials, and then he calls them to joyn together and become a Spiritual Houſe, for his Delight, Service and Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. And therefore ſuch, and only ſuch perſons ought to be Members of a Church of Chriſt; as will appear by theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God threatens, and often declares his deteſtation and abhorrence of others being there, and manifeſts his Indignation againſt them. As to the man that came to the ſupper without the Wedding Garment, Matth.</hi> 22.11, 12, 13. <hi>Then ſaid the King to his Servants, bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into outer Darkneſſe, Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The Sinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53333:29"/>who among us ſhall dwell with the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire; who amongſt us ſhall dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings?</hi> And the <hi>five fooliſh Virgins, Mat.</hi> 25. and the dreadfull end of the Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. which were the Hypocrites that by the Devils inſtigation crept into the Churches, as in the 2. to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> 4. <hi>c. Matth.</hi> 13.38, 39. It is true, that ſuch were and will be in the beſt Churches, let their Guides do all they can to prevent it, becauſe they cannot make an infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perſons ſtates (as was ſaid); and it is as certain, that they are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> and ought not to be there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For although they are by Gods providence permitted to creep in, yet be ſure they are not there with his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and allowance: <hi>they are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. for ſaith God to all the uncircumcized, <hi>What have you to do to take my Covenant into your mouth, ſeeing you hate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and caſt my words behind your Back,</hi> (as all Hypocrites do) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16, 17. and Chriſt ſays, that ſuch as <hi>will not have him to reign over them</hi> (and Hypocrites be ſure will not) <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed, Luke</hi> 19.27. Now either the Churches of God ſhould conſiſt of Saints and ſincere hearted Believers, or of formal hypocritical profeſſours, (as all are that are not prophane men, or real Saints) for all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men will confeſſe, that open prophane and debauched perſons ought not to be accounted Church Members, while they continue ſuch: not of Hypocrites, becauſe they are the moſt loathſome and abominable perſons in the ſight of God, as may be ſeen at large-in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53333:29"/>the 23 <hi>chapt.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> from the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> to the 35. and Chriſt tells us, <hi>that publicans and harlots ſhould go into the Kingdome of God before them, Matth.</hi> 21.31. And therefore they ſhould and ought to be ſincere-hearted Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and none elſe. I do not ſay that Churches ſhould account ſuch for Hypocrites, and reject them as ſuch, becauſe they do not certainly know them to be ſincere Saints who offer to joyn in fellowſhip with them: but I only ſay, that Hypocrites have no right unto, neither ought they to preſſe into the Holy Churches of Chriſt: for all the New-Teſtament Churches ſhould conſiſt onely of New Creatures, and real Members of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all Church-members ought to be ſincere hearted Believers, <hi>appears, by the high Titles that the Lord Jeſus gives unto the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Churches in the Scripture.</hi> He calls them not his Copper, but his <hi>Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, Rev.</hi> 1.20. So <hi>David</hi> deſcribes the Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within: her cloathing is of wrought Gold.</hi> So they are called <hi>Saints; holy Brethren</hi> and <hi>Beloved; elect</hi> and <hi>called; dear Children of God,</hi> and <hi>called into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Son, Rom.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that they were ſuch to whom the <hi>Goſpel came, not in word only, but alſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance:</hi> and hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that they were the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. and he tells the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>God had begun a good work in them, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53333:30"/>it,</hi> and that not in a few, but in <hi>all of them, chap.</hi> 1.5, 6. And the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> is called the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. as alſo the Holy <hi>Churches of God,</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> (as you heard before), and that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was formed into a <hi>Holy Temple of God,</hi> and made his <hi>Habitation by the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. And the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> wer the <hi>Children of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8. And <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, that they were <hi>lively ſtones, built up a Spiritual Houſe, and a Holy Prieſthood,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they were the Lords <hi>Sealed ones,</hi> that they had the Spirit of God, <hi>which had Sealed them up unto the Day of Redemption, Eph.</hi> 1.13.4.30. Now theſe glorious things that are ſpoken of the Cities or Churches of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.3. ſuch honourable Titles belong not unto meer formal profeſſours, but only unto the real members of Chriſt; not unto thoſe that have a name only, but to ſuch as are ſo indeed and in Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Reaſon is taken from the <hi>ends of Churches, or the ends of God in Inſtituting and appointing them:</hi> I'le name a few. 1. <hi>They are ſaid to be built by the Spirit for God, Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. that is, <hi>for God to dwell in them and walk in them:</hi> to reſt and repoſe himſelf in them as in his holy Walkes, Gardens, houſes and Temples, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev</hi> 2.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14. <hi>For the Lord hath chiſen</hi> Zion, <hi>he hath deſired it for his Habitation: this is my reſt for ever; here will I dwell, for I have deſired it:</hi> (Oh! that all Church-members would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53333:30"/>mind this) and in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.16, 17. it is ſaid: <hi>In that day</hi> (ſpeaking of Goſpel-times) <hi>it ſhall be ſaid to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>fear thou not: and unto</hi> Zion, <hi>let not thine hands be ſlack. The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with Joy; he will reſt in his Love, he will Joy over thee with Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> As men refreſh themſelves, and delight to be in the Houſe of their dear and hearty Friends and Relations, ſo doth God in his Churches, and <hi>as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, ſo doth God over &amp; in his own Churches, Iſa.</hi> 62.5. Now then if this be one of the holy ends of God, then ſurely they muſt be Churches of holy perſons not of Hypocrites, for God <hi>hates and abhors</hi> their preſence and ſervices, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13.—16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are intended and erected by his Spirit and Authority for his Glory in the World.</hi> When great Men build ſtetely Houſes, it is for their honour and Glory, and to diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from others: ſo when God builds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Spiritual Houſe, it is for his Honour and Glory, to diſtinguiſh his People from others. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells God, that <hi>he had built God a Houſe to dwell in; and alſo for his name,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8, 13, 19. (which he did by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and direction) ſo God appoints and ſets up particular Holy Temples by his Spirit, for his name and Glory: that <hi>they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glorious Grace;</hi> and be the <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſſes</hi> to his Name, Truths and Ways: that they ſhould be the Habitations of beauty and Glory: of fame and renown in the World, and be the lights therefore; and that <hi>with one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53333:31"/>heart and mouth they ſhould glorify God, Rom.</hi> 15.6. Golden Candleſticks in Princes Courts are ſet up for their glory, as ſuitable to their ſtate and dignity: ſo doth God erect and ſet up his Golden Candleſticks (the Churches of Believers) for his glory, as having a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his ſtate and dignity: and it is Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-<hi>holineſſe that becomes his Houſe fore ver, Pſal.</hi> 93.5. The Meſſengers of the Churches are ſaid to be <hi>the Glory of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. God calls the Church of the Jews his <hi>Glory, Iſa.</hi> 46.13. and that becauſe they were a Church of his own planting, and a Covenant people, and for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the little Remnant ſake of Believers that were amongſt them, and who glorify him indeeed &amp; in Truth. God beſtows his Grace, ſtamps his Image and infuſes his Holyneſſe into men, to meeten them for his Temple and Temple-work; and then formes and ſets them up in his own beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory, in a Church-ſtate; that there, as a Body compact, they may ſhine forth to his Glory and praiſe in the World. As many glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering daimonds in a gold Ring, do ſhine more gloriouſly upon a mans hand, than a hundred times ſo many more ſcattered up and down here and there, would do: ſo a company of men which are made pretious ſtones, fitted for a Houſe of God, being well and orderly ſet in a Church-ſtate or in a Houſe of God, do ſhine more gloriouſly there, than many more can do in a ſingle and individual capacity and ſtanding alone, to the honour and glory of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God Inſtitutes and builds Believers into Spiritual Houſes, for his peoples Spiritual profit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53333:31"/>and advantage:</hi> that God may there <hi>Impart his Loves, Cant.</hi> 7.12. and communicate his grace Truths and Counſels unto them, as to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and publique houſhold and family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. Chriſt <hi>Walkes,</hi> and God the Father <hi>Dwells</hi> there, &amp; the Holy Spirit <hi>Speaks</hi> to them in an eſpecial and frequent manner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus Chriſt does not walk, nor God the Father dwell there empty handed, but diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes plentifully of their Love and fullneſs. As great princes where they go and lodge, they will give like themſelves unto the houſhold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and much more will God, as ſome can (and more may) experience. The Church-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of ſerious holy men are the faireſt, fulleſt, cleareſt and ſtrongeſt of all they have at any times; and that becauſe God dwells there as in his holy and delightful Temple, and walks there as in his pleaſant Gardens and Walks: and where God moſtly Dwells and Walks, and takes moſt pleaſure, there he imparts moſt of his Love and Grace. It is ſaid in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>That the Glory of the Lord filled the Houſe of the Lord, ſo that the Prieſt could not ſtand to Miniſter, becauſe the glorious preſence of God was ſo exceeding great there;</hi> and his diſtributions of Love and Grace to <hi>Solomon</hi> and other Saints, ſo many and great, as that the people went <hi>home joyfull and glad of Heart, verſ.</hi> 66. and in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.16. ſays God (ſpeaking of the Temple) <hi>mine Eyes and mine Heart ſhall be there perpetually.</hi> Now if God did ſo now that material Temple made of Wood and Stone, as to manifeſt his Glory
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53333:32"/>ſo much there, impart ſo richly of his Love and Grace to his people, and promiſed to dwell there continually: how much more will he do ſo unto his New-Teſtament Churches of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. They ſhall find that prophetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made good to them, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up</hi> Zion, <hi>he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Glory.</hi> Beſides, a Church-ſtate, is a ſafe, as well as a thriving comfortable ſtate: for a Church of Chriſt rightly and duely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made up, is a <hi>Garden encloſed, Cant.</hi> 4.12. <hi>a Spring ſhut up, a Fountain ſealed</hi> (or barr'd): Whilſt Wood and Stones lie ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad they may be ſtollen and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the owner, ſo while Believers walk apart, and lie up and down ſcatteringly, they are in great danger of being ſeduced and lead away from Chriſt, with ſome of the errors of the wicked, and ſo in meaſure full from the Truth of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. but now in a Church-ſtate, or formal Houſe of God, they are ſafer and more ſecure, becauſe there they are hedged in with the diſcipline of Chriſt: there they are watched over by their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and by the Officers of Chriſt, who are their overſeers and watchmen: there they are as in the orderly Inſtituted Family or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of Chriſt, in the way and walks of Chriſt, and under the Eye and with the ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt. Whilſt an Army of Souldiers walk as ſingle and individual Perſons, ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad, they lie open to deſtruction by their Enemies; but when they are formed up, and walk together under officers and military diſcipline, every one knowing his place and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53333:32"/>keeping it, knowing the commands of their General, and obſerving them, they are ſafe, and ready to defend themſelves, and offend their Enemies. Particular and rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches of Believers, are like an <hi>Army with Banners, Cant.</hi> 6.4, 10. marching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſtant conduct of Jeſus Chriſt their Captain General, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They are formed and ſet up by Jeſus Chriſt, to be the only Seats and Subjects</hi> (as of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence) <hi>ſo of his Laws, Ordinances, Power and Authority:</hi> that they might receive, obſerve and obey his Laws, declare before all men their owning of him for their Lord, by their open and publique profeſſion of, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto him as ſuch, and that by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſingular following of him in incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Bodies, they might manifeſt to all men that they are his Subjects and diſciples; that they have choſen him for their Lord and King, and his Law for their Rule and Obedience; that they are not their own, but his, and that they have taken up in him as in their happineſs and eternal Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. That they are called out of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. and ſet apart by his Grace, for himſelf, to live unto him; and that they have taken upon themſelves his holy Yoke, and the obſervation of all his Laws. So likewiſe, that his ſubjects might <hi>with one mind and mouth together,</hi> preſent their ſervice and homage unto him, as their only Lord, Head and King. For Churches as Churches, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers walking according to his appointment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53333:33"/>and direction in Churches, are capable of his holy Supper, that glorious Pledge and Seal of his Love and Grace to them: it is called the <hi>Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and ſays the Apoſtle to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregated Church at <hi>Corinth, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, are one Bread and one Body, verſ.</hi> 17. That great ordinance of the Lords Supper is not given to Believers as ſuch only, but unto Believers as in a Church-ſtate, or incorporated into a Body or Communion together: having the name, form and order of a Church of Chriſt, and Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites were not to permit any to Eat the paſſover until they became members of their Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.47, 48. Neither will Chriſt Jeſus have any to Eat his Supper out of a Church-State, where and when they may have it in a Church-State. And (as was noted before) it is obſervable, that almoſt all the principal Doctrines and Laws of the New-Teſtament are given and directed unto the Churches, or to Believers as inchurched; as alſo Teachers and Ruling Elders are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and given to the Churches: and there the Lord Jeſus comes, and obſerves how they are received and obeyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>God hath Inſtituted and formed up Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into Churches, that he may feed and nouriſh them there, as his flocks:</hi> that he may water them as his Gardens, ſupport them as his Houſes, order and govern them as his Familys &amp; Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, and that by his Spirit &amp; Miniſters. They are appointed to water them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. to feed and nouriſh them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 23.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53333:33"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. and to rule, govern and take the over-ſight of them: <hi>Heb</hi> 13.7, 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. They are to teach and inſtruct them, to warnand caution them: to reprove and exhort them: to comfort them and build them up with the milk and ſtrong meat of Spiritual ſound Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. and that by their ſpeaking unto them (as to their own flocks and peculiar Churches and charges, from and under Chriſt) the Truths of Chriſt in Love, <hi>they may grow up into him in all things, Eph.</hi> 4.15. So alſo for Believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and orderly walking, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. God is a God of Order, and he loves to ſee his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple walking orderly and regularly, conforming themſelves to his Laws and Government. And if earthly Governours (by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) are careful to ſet up, and give unto their Subjects, Laws and Orders for their regular and orderly walking, and love greatly to ſee them ſo to walk under their Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their Cities and politick Bodies; how much more careful is Jeſus Chriſt to ſet his People in order and method, and how pleaſing and delightful muſt it needs be to Jeſus Chriſt, to ſee his Subjects walk orderly and regularly in his Cities, and Spiritual Bodies, that are of his own appointment. Theſe are ſome of the ends of God, in inſtituting and erecting of Churches. Many other might be named and inſiſted on, but that I may not exceed my Intentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Churches of Jeſus Chriſt muſt conſiſt of new-Creatures and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Believers, <hi>Becauſe they can and will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53333:34"/>anſwer and proſecute theſe aforeſaid and ſuch like holy ends of God in and by his Churches.</hi> I ſay theſe can and will becauſe they are fitted and qualified (in meaſure) by the grace and Spirit of Chriſt to aim at and effectually to proſecute theſe holy ends of God; but ſo cannot others, neither would they, if they could, becauſe they have not the ſaving Knowledge, nor practical Wiſdome of Chriſt in them: they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in Heart to Jeſus Chriſt and the Power of Godlyneſs. All others at the beſt have but a <hi>name to live, but are dead</hi> at the Root, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. neither are they made a <hi>willing People,</hi> to joyn Iſſues and comply with the holy ends of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. becauſe God hath not (by reaſon of their wickedneſſe and obſtinacy) wrought in them, <hi>to will and to do,</hi> as he hath in his peculiar people; they are not yet <hi>wrought by God for this ſelf ſame thing,</hi> as real Saints are, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. they are not <hi>renewed in the Spirit of their minds, after the Image of Him that Created them,</hi> as Saints are, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. But now real and peculiar Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are fitted and framed, moulded and polliſhed by the Holy Ghoſt, for their <hi>growing up into a holy Temple in the Lord, Eph.</hi> 2.21. and ſo by the conſtant and promiſed guidance and conduct of their living head, Jeſus Chriſt, with their Spiritual qualifications, they are enabled to anſwer and perform the great ends of God in erecting and building them up in Churches. When a wiſe man builds a Houſe, he will propound ſome ends to himſelf in his ſo doing, and accordingly he will make uſe of, and lay in ſuch materials, and ſo form and build
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53333:34"/>it, as that it may effectually anſwer his ends, if he be able: Now if he build it with hay and ſtubble, or with rotten wood, althought it may ſtand a while, yet be ſure it will not ſtand long, nor anſwer his ends. So the great maſter builder who is the Alſufficient and only wiſe God, propounded great and holy ends to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in Inſtituting and building of Churches and Temples: and theſe ſuch, as ſhould irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſtrably be obtained, notwithſtanding all poſſible contingencies &amp; Interveniencies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever for ſays God, <hi>my purpoſe ſhall ſtand and I will do all my pleaſure, Iſa.</hi> 46.10. I will build Churches and Temples, for my Glory, to dwell in them, and walk in them; to have peculiar Love, homage and ſervice from them; to have their free hearty and chearful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Reſpects: that I might enrich them with my Grace, build them up in Faith and Godlyneſs, delight in an refreſh my ſelf with them; make them a praiſe in the Earth, and <hi>Glorify the Houſes of my Glory: Iſa.</hi> 60.7. That there I may ſet my miniſtery. and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that among them I may ſet my Laws Rules and Ordinances. But hypocrites and formaliſts will never anſwer nor proſecute theſe ends, as I found by experience among the Old-Church-Members of the <hi>Jews:</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look for it, nor expect it from them; for they are a people of an other Spirit; they ſlight my Grace and reject my eaſy yoke: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall not be honoured with member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in my Churches; in my particular Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Churches; but if they creep in (as many will do) I will loath and abhor their preſence,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53333:35"/>I will root them up, caſt them out, and that into everlaſting fire: for whatever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be, yet I know that they are not for my Turn and will ſtand me in no ſtead there, but to provoke me to wrath with their Hypocriſy, and make fuell for the fire of my Jealouſy. Therefore my New-Teſtament-Churches ſhall be built only of Holy and Spiritual materials, not of dead, but living Stones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. ſuch as my Word and Spirit ſhall polliſh and prepare for that work and Service, that ſo by them I may obtain my Holy ends and carry on my great deſignes. I know that my peculiar People will receive, ſubmit unto, and obey my Laws; that they will Love and honour me, that they will ſhine as lights in the World, and that they will give me kind and cordial entertainment, and that will cleave to and not forſake me. Therefore they ſhall be my Churches.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe all the Laws, Ordinances and Works of Church-Members are holy, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly.</hi> They are ſuch as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man underſtands not, cannot diſcern what they are, and that becauſe they are ſuch, and they that are not taught of God ſavingly and powerfully, to underſtand and make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, do think and Judge of them carnally and vainly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. — end. But Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have them written in their Minds and Hearts beforehand; they have them not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book; I mean they have the ſame Laws of Chriſt written in the books of their hearts, which they find in the <hi>Bible, Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16. by which they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53333:35"/>and (in ſome meaſure) enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, receive, love and rightly obey, the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt without. The <hi>Laws,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, is Spiritual, Rom.</hi> 7. and a real ſound Believer is called a <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. Their Laws are Holy and Spiritual: their works and buſineſſes in a Church are ſo likewiſe, <hi>John</hi> 4.23, 24 <hi>Eph.</hi> 5, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and a particular congregated Church is called a <hi>Holy-Temple,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Houſe, Eph.</hi> 2.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. They have a Holy God, <hi>(who is a Spirit)</hi> to Serve and Worſhip, a Spiritual head to believe in and obey, and Holy and Spiritual Work to do in their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and therefore they had need be Holy and Spiritual Perſons, not without in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, but within in Truth. Almoſt all the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt are committed to them, and God expects his principal and choiceſt Worſhip from his Churches, and they are all above and beyond the reach of carnal Men. God firſt makes Spiritual Men, and then with them he formes Spiritual Houſes, and then as ſuch, he gives them Holy Laws and Ordinances, and ſpiritual work to do; and requires them to do it as ſpiritual Perſons and Churches. Chriſt doth not form them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Churches as reaſonable men, but as good, Holy and Spiritual men, and ſuits his Laws to their Capacities and States; as at firſt he framed and ſuited them to his Laws. Chriſt calls his People into Churches, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted congregated Bodies, that they may as ſuch receive and practice his ſpiritual and Holy Church Laws and Ordinances, for his Glory
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53333:36"/>and their good; and they are ſpiritual Laws and Ordinances for ſpiritual men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only ſuch ſhould be Members of Chriſt's Churches. For what ſhall Hypocrites do in the Holy ſpiritual Temples and Churches of God, and what uſe will they make of Chriſt's Laws and Holy Ordinances, but to defile and polute them, and <hi>eat and drink their own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi> 1 Cor. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Becauſe the ſeparation between Saints and Sinners begun here in this Life, by the Lords calling men out of the World and forming them up into Holy Temples for himſelf, is the beginning of that everlaſting ſeparation that ſhall be in the great day of Chriſt his appearing, between the Sheep and the Goats; Matth.</hi> 25.31, 32, 41. or at leaſt a ſhadow and reſemblance of it; for the comfort of the Saints and terror of the wicked. Says Chriſt hereafter I will come in Glory, ſet upon my <hi>Throne,</hi> before <hi>me ſhall be gathered all nations,</hi> and then will I <hi>ſeperate them on from another, as a Shepherd divideth this Sheep from the Goats.</hi> 31, 32. <hi>and then I will ſay to the Sheep, come ye Bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdome prepared for you;</hi> and to the other, <hi>go ye Curſed into everlaſting ſire:</hi> 34.41. Now becauſe you wil not believe me, nor what I ſay in this matter, ſee what I have begun already in it; you ſee a few ſeperated from you in this world before your eyes, and formed up into Holy-Temples for me: and this is not their own Work, or done of themſelves, or of their own minds and carnal apprehenſions, or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proud notions and Opinions (as you falſly charge them) no, but this thing is done of me:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53333:36"/>I will own it as my own Work; for I have commanded them to ſeparate, and have called them out from amongſt you, who continue ſtill in your Infidelity and unregenerate States, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. and bid them congregate together as my peculiar People, and become my Spiritual Houſes and Churches; and I have by my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made them willing and moved their hearts to do ſo, as you ſee them do: I own them, and will ſtand by them in it, for it is not ſo much they that have ſeparated themſelves, as it is I my ſelf that have done it: and what they have done therein is in obedience unto me, and that to convince you of the Truth of my Word for as certainly as you ſee theſe my People now ſeparated from you, ſo I will at the laſt day make an eternal ſeperation between them and you, unleſs you repent and become my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Seaſon. And as it is intended for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and terror of the wicked, ſo alſo for the comfort and confirmation of Believers; for by the Lords ſeparating them from the World and building them up into Holy-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he gives them a notable pledge, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the aſſured and promiſed difference, of that great and everlaſting diſcrimination &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, that ſhall be between them and the wicked. Now good men are apt to think that (becauſe all things ſeems to happen alike to all as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) that there is no difference, or very little between the wicked and them (although there is indeed a vaſt difference, (upon many accounts) between them now) and ſo are apt to be diſcouraged in their duties
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53333:37"/>and walkings; but to chear them up, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Spirits; here ſays God is a very great diſtinguiſhing difference, and a pledge of a greater between you and the World. <hi>I have called you out of the World, and brought you near unto my Self:</hi> I have ſeperated you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready from the Lions and Goats and made you my formal and publique habitations and Holy-Temples; which is your honour, priviledg and dignity. I do not ſay that all, that are not of ſuch or ſuch particular Churches, are Goats, or unbelievers, no, I cannot entertain ſuch a thought in my Heart; for as I think and fear, that there are many hypocrites crept into Churches, ſo I believe that there are many gracious Perſons, which to their own loſſe, and Gods diſhonour, do live out of Church-fellowſhip: ſo their are others that would joyn with them, but cannot, and others can, but will not. But I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt will have his Churches made up of Saints only, and not of ſuch as ſhall be everlaſtingly ſeperated, but of ſuch as ſhall live and reign with Jeſus Chriſt for evermore, in the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; and that for this reaſon (among others) becauſe it may comfort, and confirm the Saints in their hope and walking with God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and terrify the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Churches ought to be built of Believers and regenerate perſons, <hi>becauſe they may continue and ſtand faſt in all Storms and Tempeſts, and hold out unto the end, as being built upon the Rock Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For whatever Church is builded upon the <hi>Sand</hi> and not upon the Lord Jeſus, and by the Authority and help
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53333:37"/>of his Word and Spirit, will not ſtand long; becauſe it wants a bottome to bear up its weight. They muſt all be built upon the Rock and chief corner-Stone; the foundation that God hath laid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24, 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. the Lord Jeſus tells us, <hi>that upon this Rock</hi> (that was himſelf and the Truths that <hi>Peter</hi> had confeſſed) <hi>will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Hypocrites are not built upon Chriſt, for if they were, that great promiſe of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance would belong to them, and then the ſtony Ground would be in as good and ſafe a condition. as the good Ground; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is apparent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. But it is certain that they are not built on Chriſt by faith, but are vocted in themſelves, and build their vain hopes on a ſandy Foundation, <hi>Job.</hi> 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. and in many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is manifeſt. Therefore, if there perſons are not built on Chriſt, their Church-ſtate is not, but upon the Sand. Hence then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that only ſound Believers are built on Chriſt and ſo they are the perſons only that Chriſt will have built up into Holy-Temples: becauſe the Churches that Chriſt builds, (he himſelf ſays,) he will build upon himſelf, that they may ſtand inpregnably in all weathers, and that is only of ſuch as are united unto him by Faith, and have choſen him for their only Rock and Foundation, by a lively Faith, and not of ſuch as do ſecretly reject him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be ſaid, that, the Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. ſpeaks of the inviſible Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And I am ſpeaking too of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53333:38"/>Members of the Catholick Church; and ſay, that all particular congregated Churches of Believers, are, or ought (to be ſuch as are united unto and built upon Chriſt by Faith; and that theſe ought) to congregate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Churches of God and none elſe; and that according unto the directions of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt: and then, if they be indeed ſuch, that promiſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> belongs to them, and they ſhall be ſecured by it, as well as the Catholick Church, although they be formed up (according to Chriſts his Inſtitution) into particular congregational Churches. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (after they are thus formed) they may be broken (in a Senſe) and ſcattered, as the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. yet they are ſtill ſecured by that promiſe, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other in Faith. Love, tears and Prayers: in Judgment and affection.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus ſuffers in name and Glory by the fall of his Churches, or ſuch as pretend to be ſo: as he that built his houſe on the ſand is called a fooliſh man, by Spectators, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. and if Churches ſhould be ſo built, either for want of a good Foundation, or good matter, or wiſe and carefull cementing and forming up the materials; how greatly will the Wiſdom and care of Chriſt ſuffer, by the Tongues of his Enemies, becauſe ſuch Churches took upon themſelves the name of Chriſt and pretended to be his people and to walk by his Laws. And as the fall of them will be a Reproach to Chriſt, ſo it will be matter of grief and ſcandal to the weak Members of Chriſt alſo whether they were in, or out of thoſe Churches, thus fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53333:38"/>and it will greatly harden the hearts of Sinners againſt the good ways of God, and cauſe them to think that there is no reality in his Goſpel Religion; and therefore Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure, to ſee his houſes fall to the ground, but takes care, that all that he builds by his Word and Spirit, be ſo built and ſecured, as that the Gates of Hell ſhall not overthrow them, nor by any means prevail againſt them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them and that becauſe they are founded, ſecured &amp; ſupported by his promiſe and Spirit.</p>
               <p>I might produce many other Reaſons for the proof and confirmation of this Truth, that none but real Believers ought to be formed up into a Church of Chriſt. As concerning the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and promiſes that belong to a Church of Chriſt. There are many of them (which may be ſpoken of, on an other head) which are two high and glorious for the Inglorious profeſſing Hypocrities; and therefore they muſt be entayled only on the true heirs of them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the living Members of Chriſt and Children of God. Hypocrites who refuſe to have Chriſt on his own Terms, and who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr their Luſts before him, and their own Righteouſneſſe, before Chriſts, and daily make him a <hi>Lyar,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. have nothing to do with them. There is a <hi>little Remnant called out of the World,</hi> to whom they do onely belong, and they, and only they, may claim them as their own. Again, becauſe only Believers are Chriſts willing ſubjects, ſuch as have freely put their necks under his Yoke, and given up themſelves in univerſal obedience to him, and that have heartily choſen him for their Lord
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53333:39"/>and Governour, and his Laws for their Rule and practice But it is well known, that all other men do reject him, and yeild obedience unto the Devil and their Luſts. They will have the Lord Jeſus bow down to their Terms, but they will not come up to his. They ſay as thoſe in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60. this is a hard Yoke, who can bear it: and therefore although we will profeſſe him, that we will not have him rule over us. And therefore he doth not call them to partake of the Children of the Kingdomes Bread, or to his true Subjects priviledges and Bleſſings, whileſt they continue ſuch. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, only true Believers are <hi>Clean,</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi> all others are unclean: They are ſtrangers to him and his People) <hi>unwaſhed and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized in Ears and Hearts.</hi> They are not <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed</hi> nor <hi>Sanctifyed,</hi> nor purged from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe <hi>by the blood of the Lamb:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not come near to, or touch the holy things of his Church, which are holy, pure things, and ſanctifyed unto the holy uſe of his enchurched-members. I would not be tedious, and therefore ſhall wave all further conſideration of this matter, although I could multiply Reaſons to prove, that only real true Believers ſhould be Church-Members. But I ſhall ſpeak a few words for the removing of an objection advanced againſt this Truth, which is this. But we read of <hi>Tares</hi> in the field, amongſt the good wheat, good and bad fiſhes, caught in the neet of the Goſpel, and brought into the Kingdome, which is the Church of God; as alſo many evil members in ſeveral of the Congregational Churches, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53333:39"/>in the Scripture, and therefore Churches may conſiſt of good and bad men.</p>
               <p>All this may be true, and yet the Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, not at all touched or weakened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. It is true, if there were evil members in thoſe Goſpel Churches, and they proved evil Members indeed, and great afflictions to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Paul,</hi> and the good Members of them. But what then? ought they to have been there, or were they known to be ſuch indeed to the Apoſtles and other good men, when they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them? were they there by Chriſts call, and with his approbation and allowance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he permitted them to creep in among his People? Now unleſſe it can be proved that they ought to be there, that they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when known to be ſuch, as afterward they appeared to be, that it was their duty and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, while ſuch, and that Chriſt approved there being there: I ſay until that be proved by the word of God, we muſt conclude that they were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> and had nothing to do in the Churches of Chriſt, I do not diſcourſe of who were in the Churches, but who ought to be there: Not who thought themſelves worthy and crept in of their own accord, but who Chriſt called there, and came in, in obedience to him. I am ſure they were not welcome to Chriſt or his People: the Apoſtles wiſhes ſuch <hi>were Cut off: Gal.</hi> 5.12. and exhorts Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>to withdraw from them that walked diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>and to turn away from them,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>to mark and avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16.17. and the Lord Jeſus gives in charge to his Churches, that they proſecute his Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53333:40"/>diſorderly Church-members, even to the caſting of them out of the Church, in caſe they repent not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. and threatens the evil Members of the Churches of <hi>Sardis &amp; Laodicea,</hi> ſeverely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. and therefore ſurely, if they were Hypocrites, he would not have found them there, to diſhonour his name and grieve his People, as they did.</p>
               <p>And as for the inſtances of the <hi>Tares, and bad fiſhes brought into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> no more can be ſaid for the juſtifing them, in what they did, than of the other, before minded and anſwered, and the ſame Anſwer will refell theſe two likewiſe. But if you mind it, you will find that the Tares there, if meant of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and not of doctrines (which is a queſtion) are ſaid to be the <hi>Children of the wicked one, and he that ſowed them was the Devil, verſ.</hi> 38, 39. So that theſe Tares, or Members, were not of Jeſus Chriſt his bringing there, but of the Devils; and who will ſay then that they ought to be there? Will Jeſus Chriſt have the Devils hand and help to enlarge his Church, or will he accept and approve of ſuch perſons for his Church-members, to help forward the building of his holy Temple, for the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that are choſen and ſent by the Devil? As for others it is expreſly ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. that <hi>he that ſoweth the good Seed, is the Son of Man:</hi> and in oppoſition thereunto, it is ſaid, his Enemy the Devil ſowed Tares in the ſame field, which was hurtfull unto the good ſeed. Therefore (as I ſaid before) that Hypocrites are not called nor ſent by Jeſus Chriſt into Churches, but by the Devil: which is a good
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53333:40"/>Reaſon againſt their being there. And to what purpoſe are they there, but to grattify the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and their own Luſts, to afflict and grieve (if not corrupt) the good Seed, to diſhonour Chriſt and encreaſe their own miſery.</p>
               <p>As to the good and bad Fiſhes, there need no more be ſaid concerning them, then that Hypocrites and rotten hearted men will croud into the Churches of Chriſt, amongſt his good People, but they ought not ſo to do, for they are not called to come, becauſe they are of Satans Kingdome of darkneſſe, and have no part or portion with the true Children of God and heirs of his Kingdome. So that I think there hath been enough ſaid as to that, namely, that none ought to be Members of Chriſts par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, but real Believers. And now I ſhould proceed to ſpeak of the form of a particular congregated Church of Chriſt, but that I think it neceſſary to ſpeak a little unto two <hi>Queſtions</hi> firſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>What fitneſs or qualifications ſhould Believers find in themſelves for their own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, before they enter into fellowſhip, &amp; become Church-members, or joyn themſelves as members to ſome Church of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt they ſhould have a well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hope of their Regeneration, or new ſtate in Chriſt, that they have ſeen their need of Chriſt; ſingled him out (by grace) and choſen him upon his own Terms: that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a meaſure of his <hi>anointings,</hi> Grace, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, light and Life, and that they are accepted in the Lord Jeſus: that they <hi>have put off the Old Man, and put on the New,</hi> and <hi>are renewed</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53333:41"/>in meaſure, by the word and Spirit, <hi>after the Image of Chriſt.</hi> I ſay, they ſhould have at leaſt, a well grounded hope. For many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hearts have ſuch a hope, that have no aſſurance; who hold their Title and claim to Chriſt and Heaven, but had never the ſeal of it on their hearts; or if they ever had it, they have by their own careleſneſs loſt it; and ſo have only hope left. And this indeed will hold their Souls in Life (by the Spirit) though not in comfort and ſatisfaction: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. and the Apoſtle tells ſuch that they are <hi>ſaved by hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24. and that they are the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hope,</hi> which puts them upon that great and Noble Work, <hi>of purifying themſelves, as he is pure:</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. and ſtirs them up, to <hi>perfect holyneſſe in the fear of God:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. As faith that precedes it, doth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hope</hi> is not a dead, but a lively hope: it is not idle but operative and working; it is active and laborious in purging out of Luſts, and getting in of Holyneſs and Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. as a ſound ſpecial Faith is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.18. And the Apoſtle tells us; that it is an <hi>Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, Heb.</hi> 6.19. ſo when God promiſes mercies unto his People, he tells them, that he will give them a <hi>door of hope, Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. which hope <hi>is Chriſt in them, Phil.</hi> 1.27. And therefore if you have this Hope, you are in a happy State, and ought to joyn your ſelves unto ſome Church of Chriſt, give up your ſelves in univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, and wait in a houſe of God for his Seal, and the full aſſurance of his love
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53333:41"/>to your Souls.

               <p n="1">1.

Job.</hi> 42.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="5">5.

Are you glad when you find it, and ſad, when by your own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs you loſe it? doth it (when obtained) quicken your love to, and zeal for Chriſt; doth it warm your hearts and cauſe them (for a time) to run your race in Goſpel obedience, cheerfully? doth it lead you unto, and lodge your hearts in Chriſt, and doth it oblige and bind them faſter unto him, and doth it ſtir you up to thankfulneſſe?</p>

Is it your care, aim and endeavour, to carry your ſelves ſincerely before him, and to approve your ſelves unto him, under the fear &amp; conviction of his all ſeeing Eye? Is it the great thing you mind and aim at, in your profeſſion and practice; namely, ſincerity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Heart: do you make conſcience of drawing near to God with it, and to ſeaſon every duty with this divine Salt? do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſire, chuſe and endeavour to be <hi>after Gods own Heart</hi> (as David was) <hi>and Nathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els indeed, in whom is no Guile,</hi> although you cannot get clear, nor rid your ſelves of all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, as you ſhould?

Are you afraid of Hypocriſy, and do you watch and ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as againſt an Enemy to God and your own Souls, and are you grieved indeed, when you find it in you?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Do you deſire and chuſe Jeſus Chriſt for the great object of your Love, Delight and Joy; and do you find him to be ſo, in ſome Meaſure?</hi> do you deſire and endeavour to make him the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your ſtrongeſt and warmeſt affections, and to love him Sincerely, Heartily, Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fervently and conſtantly; and do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your Love to him, by keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and <hi>doing the things that are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in his ſight?

Are theſe, and ſuch like ends, in your minds and hearts, in your walking in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and can you find the forementioned mark or ſigns of Grace in you, in meaſure, though not ſo clearly and fully as you would? Why then I may boldly and humbly tell you, that you are fitted and qualified for Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, that you are called and invited into the houſe and Temple of God, and that you are indiſpenſibly bound to anſwer to the call of God, and ſay, <hi>behold Lord, we come unto thee,</hi> and will freely without delay; thankfully without grudying; humbly without pride, with mourning and rejoycing, <hi>enter into thy Courts;</hi> joyn with thy Churches, and grow into a holy Temple to thy Praiſe and Honour. We will no longer ſlight our great priviledges, neglect our great and indiſpenſible Duties, or walk diſorderly, as we have done: but we do now willingly come and offer our ſelves unto thee, and to enter into a ſolemn engagement, to be thine, to walk in all thy ways, and do the things that pleaſe thee.</p>
               <p>I ſay, that Church priviledges are yours; the doors of Gods houſe ſtand open for you; Chriſt ſtands at the door and waites for you: he invites you to come in, ſit down at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and you ſhall be moſt freely and heartily welcome to your Lord, and his people. And know, that it is your unavoidable and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty to enter into his houſe.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53333:45"/>
               <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>Ought a Church of Chriſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Guides thereof, to let in any that profeſſe the name and waies of Jeſus Chriſt; (and offer themſelves unto them) or ought they not to try and prove them firſt, whether they are rightly qualified by the grace of Chriſt, for full member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with his people: if ſo, then what are the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications they ſhould look for, and find in them, for their own ſatisfaction, which they admit into the holy Temple of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is certain, that all that profeſſe the name of Chriſt and his waies, ought not, may not be admitted into the Lords holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; becauſe many, if not the moſt of them, are very Ignorant of Chriſt and his ways, and notorious ſcandalous in their Lives: as ſad and wofull experience ſhews.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been (I think) ſufficiently proved before, that not any but real-hearted ſound Believers, are fit materials for a houſe and holy Temple of God; and if ſo, then a Church, or the Guides thereof, may not admit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but ſuch only as they judge by the word of God, and their own charitable diſcretion, are ſuch indeed; although 'tis poſſible they may be <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> but they may not admit them if they groundedly know, or think them to be ſuch. For if they ſhould admit ſuch againſt their knowledge, they betray their Truſts, and defile Chriſts holy Temple, by taking in ſuch perſons as they know, or ought to know, Chriſt would not have there. And that they ought to try and prove perſons, that they may know their worthineſſe and fitneſſe before they admit them in, is clear, in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26. and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53333:45"/>becauſe Chriſt hath committed the keys of his Temple unto them, to take in, and put out, according to his will and Appointment. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he blames <hi>Some</hi> for ſuffering <hi>Tares</hi> (if meant of perſons) to be <hi>ſowen in his Kingdome,</hi> and not endeavouring to prevent and keep them out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. ſays he, <hi>while men Slept, the Enemy came and ſowed Tares:</hi> that is, while ſuch as ſhould have kept the Temple Gates ſhut againſt them, to have kept them out, were negligent and careleſſe of their duty: for they ſhould have done all they could to have kept out the Devils ſeed; for what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement hath the <hi>Seed of the Serpent with the Seed of the Woman,</hi> &amp; the Rebells with the true Subjects of Chriſt? or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to ſatisfying qualifications in perſons deſiring admiſſion into Churches: I ſay, that when they have been well tryed and are found (in the Judgment of Charity) ſuch as Chriſt hath received and competently qualifyed for Church memberſhip, they ought to <hi>receive them in the Lord, Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they can make forth, and declare unto the Church, their (at leaſt ſeemingly) Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Converſion, Repentance and Faith in Chriſt: their knowledge of Chriſt and his ways, Laws and Ordinances; of their loſt and periſhing ſtate in Sin, and by reaſon of it, and their ſincere deſires and Reſolutions to become the Lords, and to walk with him unto all well-pleaſing in all his ways.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If they are ſound in the Faith of the Goſpel,</hi> I mean in the chief and principal Doctrines and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53333:46"/>Truths thereof; although they may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, or err in leſſer matters. If they have ſome diſtinct knowledge, and Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe, and other ſuch Truths and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contained in the word of God. As of the ſtate and condition wherein man was firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. How he loſt that holy and bleſſed State, and the miſery he brought himſelf, and all his poſterity into thereby. Concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they <hi>are by nature Children of wrath, dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and condemned to eternal Death.</hi> That they are Enemies to, and at enmity with God. That they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor power by nature, either to will or do that which they ought, and is pleaſing to God. That they have forſaken God, and are under the Curſe of the Law, and that they are the Children, Subjects and Servants of the Devil, World and their own Luſts. That God left not all men in this State and condition, but provided an all-ſufficient Remedy, namely, Jeſus Chriſt, and that by an Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, entered into with Chriſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of men, before the Foundation of the World, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. and that in purſuance thereof, he elected and gave ſome to Chriſt, that he might ſave them, and that of his meer Grace and Love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, 40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. That God the Father gave and ſet his Son, the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity, to mediate peace between God and Men, and to reconcile men to God, by his active and paſſive Obedience. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf, and became a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their Sins.</hi> That he aſſumed our nature,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53333:46"/>and took it up into a perſonal Union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereby there are two natures in one Perſon, by which he was made capable of his <hi>Mediatorſhip.</hi> That he being God-man in one Perſon, took upon himſelf our guilt and puniſhment: obeyed the whole Law of God, that men had broken, and <hi>did always do the things that pleaſed God.</hi> That when he had finiſhed his active obedience, <hi>he became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the death of the Croſſe,</hi> to the wrath of God, and curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. That he really dyed and was buried, lay in the Grave, and roſe again the third day, and after forty days, he went up into Heaven, <hi>and ſate down on the right Hand of God,</hi> and that <hi>he will come again to Judge the Quick and Dead.</hi> That he is <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet.</hi> A King to give Laws unto men, and command their obedience to them: to rule and Govern his Subjects, and to reward the obedient and puniſh the diſobedient. That <hi>all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, is committed unto him,</hi> and that he is coequally and coeternally God with the Father and holy Spirit.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53333:47"/>ouſneſs and Judgment, Joh,</hi> 3.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.1, 8.13, 14, 15. That all that rightly <hi>Believe in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, but thoſe that believe not ſhall be damned,</hi> and that all that believe in Chriſt, <hi>muſt be careful to do good Works.</hi> That Believers are made righteous with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they have none of their own to commend them unto God. That God hath <hi>made</hi> Jeſus Chriſt unto his choſen, <hi>Righteouſneſſe, wiſdome, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and that they are <hi>made the Righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> That God imputed their ſins to Chriſt, and imputes the blood and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt to them; and that they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified thereby, and not by inherent holyneſſe and Righteouſneſſe. That God Loves, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Juſtifyes and Saves men <hi>Freely,</hi> without any reſpect to their good Works, as any cauſe thereof, but all the moving cauſe (without himſelf) is Jeſus Chriſt and his mediation. That the Ground and reaſon of their obedience and doing Good works, is the revealed will and pleaſure of Chriſt commanding them, and the ends of them are to expreſſe their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, for his Grace and Love: to pleaſe and honour Him: to meet with God and enjoy communion with him: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his Grace and the good of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; To ſhine as lights in the World and be uſeful unto men: to declare whoſe and what they are, and to lie up for a reward in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World: to keep their Luſts under and their graces in uſe and exerciſe; and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their Reſpect and Subjection to Jeſus
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53333:47"/>Chriſt, his Authority and Law. That the Law for the matter of it, as qualified by Chriſt, is the Rule and Law of all obedience; &amp; that all are bound to yield obedience &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it. That there ſhall be a <hi>Reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> That <hi>Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it none can enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Joh.</hi> 2.3, 5, 7. That the Scriptures of the Old and New-Teſtament contain and hold forth unto men the whole revealed will of God, and are <hi>ſufficient to make the man of God perfect, thorowly furniſhed to every good Work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. and that whatſoever you are to believe and do, is contained therein, and that it is the ground of their Faith, Hope and Practice. That Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted and appointed many Ordinances of Worſhip, for his own Glory and his Peoples profit, and that all are bound to obſerve, and waite on God in them. That all perſons are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bound to mind and carefully to obſerve the principal manner and end of all their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to ſee that they be right, holy and Spiritual indeed, and not pleaſe themſelves with the matter of duty without them. That no men can ſerve God, or do any acceptable work unto him, until they are regenerate and put into a ſtate of Grace. Theſe are ſome of the matters of Faith, that they ſhould rightly (in meaſure) underſtand and believe, that are admitted into full memberſhip in the Churches of Chriſt. And theſe and other Truths, muſt not be notionally, lightly and in the general known and believed, but heartily, powerfully
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53333:48"/>and particularly, not for others, but themſelves, or elſe their faith and knowledge will no way profit their Souls to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt be qualified alſo with blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſations. <hi>Their Converſations muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Goſpel, Phil.</hi> 1.27. or elſe they are not meet for memberſhip with Goſpel-Churches. Carnal walkings will not ſuit ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Temples. For they will greatly pollute and defile them; ſtain and darken their beauty and Glory. Therefore they muſt not be <hi>braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or contentious Perſons:</hi> they muſt not be coveteous and worldly minded; vain and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons. They muſt not be <hi>froward and peeviſh Perſons;</hi> neither muſt, or may they be <hi>Defrauders,</hi> or ſuch as detain others dues care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſy from them: nor ſuch as ſlight the worſhip of God in their Families, or are careleſſe of Governing, and educating them in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the things of God. They may not be ſuch, as are known to neglect duties and ordinances in their times and ſeaſons, or to have vitious families through their neglects: nor any other ſuch kind of perſons, whoſe ſtinking Spirits and converſations, are odious to God and his People. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their profeſſion be, they may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or received into the holy Temples of God, until they have repented, of theſe or any other hateful and ſcandalous evil, in their carriages and walkings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If they are ſuch as have choſen the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for their King and head; given up and made over themſelves, to Jeſus Chriſt, to live in him and to him:</hi> have ſingled him out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53333:48"/>and ſet him apart (as it were) to be the object of their truſt; Love and delight, of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience. If they have choſen and cloſed up with him upon his own Terms (as they hope), renounceing and rejecting all their own Righteouſneſſe, worthyneſſe, Intereſts, and ſufficiency, and choſen and appropriated him to themſelves, for their Righteouſneſſe, worthyneſſe, portion and ſufficiency; upon the ſight and conviction of the nothingneſs, emptineſſe and inſufficiency of their own; and with a heart ſatisfyed with perſwaſion of the lovelyneſſe, fullneſſe, and ſufficiency of Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And if all this be ſeriouſly, humbly, ſelf-debaſingly and heartily done, ſo far as Men may Judge?</hi> Is it done, or do they make known the dealings of God with their Souls, and their faith in Chriſt, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and (at leaſt ſeemingly) with ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with the ſenſe and feeling of what they declare? you may alſo be much helped in making a right Judgment of them, whether they are ſent of God, as fitted by him for Church memberſhip, by the ends they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto themſelves, and declare unto you, in deſiring memberſhip with you. If they do ſeriouſly profeſſe that what they do, is in obedience to the will and (as they judge) the call of Chriſt, as their indiſpenſible duty, and that they dare not live any longer in the neglect of the Church-ordinances of Chriſt. That they joyn in fellowſhip to meet with and enjoy God; to receive of his fulneſſe, to fit and enable them to the performance of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conform their hearts and lives to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53333:49"/>will of God in all things: and other ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named. To which they do ſeriouſly bind themſelves to God to perform and proſecute, as alſo to walk and carry themſelves in his Church, according to the will of God, through the Grace of Chriſt. I ſay ſuch may undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be accounted worthy Members, and be received in as ſuch.</p>

               <p n="6">6. QUeſt. <hi>What is the</hi> formalis ratio; <hi>or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of a particular Church of Chriſt? or how, and by what means ſhould Believers and fit materials be formed up, and become a beautiful formal Houſe or Temple of God, for him to dwell in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it is certain (in experience) that every houſe conſiſts of matter and form, and as men cannot have houſes to dwell in, without matter and form, or materials for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, and laid together in order by the Art of Men, ſo cannot God (properly) have a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual houſe without matter and form. God alludes to mens houſes, and the old <hi>Jewiſh Temple,</hi> when he calls and ſtiles his Goſpel Churches, his houſes and Temples; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Cities and Corporations, that are of mens forming: and we all know, that a great number of materials ſcattered abroad, lying here and there, make not a houſe, although they are well fitted and framed for a houſe, but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53333:49"/>it is the orderly forming them up together that makes a houſe. <hi>David</hi> provided many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent materials to build God a houſe, yet ſays God, <hi>thou ſhalt not build it, but Solomon thy Son ſhall:</hi> and it was not a houſe until <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> days; he made the houſe of <hi>Davids</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials. So a Company, or great number of Believers ſcattered up and down here and there, make not a Goſpel-Church, or holy Temple of God, how holy and excellent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are; no more than the materials for the Temple, made a Temple in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> days: It is contrary to every mans reaſon and experience to imagine it. Neither are a number of Believers meeting occaſionally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the celebration of ſome Ordinances (though often) therefore a Church, although they know and love each other, and are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the good ſtates of each other: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth their living together within the bounds or limits of a Pariſh make them a Church, nor all of them together: becauſe they want the conſtitutive cauſe, or <hi>(formalis ratio)</hi> of a Church or Houſe of God. Hence ſays the Text in alluſion unto material houſes, and the Jewiſh Temple, which was once the place of the ſpecial worſhip and preſence of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5, 11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>Ye are built and fitly framed, for a habitation of God,</hi> and being ſo framed, and that not by man, but the Spirit, <hi>ye grow into a Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord.</hi> And the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was ſo built into a Holy-Temple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. Now if a number of company of Believers dwelling near together,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53333:50"/>as in Cities uſually they do, and their occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal meeting together to worſhip God in ſome Ordinances, did make them a formal houſe of God; what need of building them up into a houſe? and it is a matter of great weight and moment to me, what the Apoſtle ſays in the Text, (laſt <hi>verſ.</hi>) concerning the holy Spirit, namely, that he ſhould be the great Agent and doer of it; which clearly ſhews, that it is a matter of very great concernment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God and Believers, to have them well and orderly formed together into a Church, Houſe or Temple of God: for elſe the holy Spirit would never thus appropriate it, and the whole of it unto himſelf, as being only able to do it, as his own proper work; it being too great for men &amp; Angels to do, but from and by him. And I think if it were ſo light and inconſiderable a matter as ſome would have it, it would have been a great diſhonour, rather than an honour to the holy Ghoſt, to have entitled himſelf to it, and have taken it upon himſelf, as the ſole cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>And as the Jewiſh Temple was ſo to be built and formed, as that it might continue in its beauty and glory, ſo undoubtedly ought the Lords Spiritual Temples now: not for a few days, but for ever: for otherwiſe they will be rather like the Iſraelites Tents and Tabernacle in the wilderneſſe, tranſcient and removing from place to place, while they were Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards their reſt; but when they were ſetled in their Land, then they were to have a fixed Temple to meet God in: and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaking to and of the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53333:50"/>Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> alludes unto the Temple of God at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as a fixed ſetled place of Gods worſhip; when he ſays, they are a <hi>holy Temple and habitation of God.</hi> Now if perſons occaſionally meeting together for the worſhip of God, make a Goſpel Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, then they may be here to Day, and gone to Morrow; In ſuch a place was a Church &amp; Temple of God Yeſterday, but none to Day; for they are not fixed, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient: they are no more bound to one another, with whom they ſometimes walked, than to others of Gods People, which they never ſaw till to Day: And if they have a mind to do ſo, they may go to five or ten ſeveral places to Morrow, and five take up with one Miniſter, and ten with another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Week, Month or Year, as they pleaſe; if they be not formed and builded together, and bound faſt together, as a Houſe, Temple or Family under the rule, Inſpection, and teaching of fixed ſtated Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. For either they belong to one fixed houſhold and Family, or to none at all; they have their own <hi>Officers</hi> or none at all: for if they are as a Common, without any bounds or property, as they muſt be, if not fixed and tyed ſome where, how many abſurdities will unavoidably follow? As firſt, while they are in this moving and wandering condition, they are not a Houſe or Temple of God, but ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Stones and Timber, and ſo cannot bear the name and honour of a Holy Temple and Church of God. 2. They cannot whileſt in ſuch a condition, be called, owned or accounted a Holy Church and Temple of God, either by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53333:51"/>God or Men. 3. Neither ſhall they have, neither indeed can they expect or look for Church-bleſſings and priviledges, or claim the Good of the promiſes made to Saints as a formed, fixed Temple or Houſe of God, as that God ſhould dwell &amp; walk with &amp; amongſt them, as he hath promiſed to do in his Churches and Temples, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. Neither can they orderly participate of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> for that Ordinance belongs to the fixed houſholds of God, not to ſcattered Saints occaſionally meeting together, as Saints only, without any tye or obligation one to another, and to their Miniſters, that ſhould Miniſter it unto them; theſe and other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they cannot claim while they walk irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and diſorderly. 4. They make the ordinance &amp; Inſtitution of particular Churches null and void, and of no force and vertue at all; and ſo Chriſt hath Inſtituted and appointed them in vain, that they are of no uſe, profit or concernment unto Saints. For it will inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow (I think) that in caſe their looſe walkings, without any fixed order or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on each other, to live together as a diſtinct houſhold or Family of God, be the condition wherein they ſhould live and walk; that then they have found out a better way to live and walk in, for the glory of God, and their own profit, than Jeſus Chriſt hath done, and ſo they do practically controul him, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſay, that they are wiſer than Chriſt, <hi>the Wiſdom of God;</hi> for they have found out a more pleaſing and profitable way for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than Chriſt appointed and inſtituted for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53333:51"/>them; ſo that Jeſus Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt, might have ſpared their pains in that matter; &amp; ſo the Inſtitution, and the Love, Wiſdome, care and Authority of Chriſt in that caſe, are all thrown down to the ground. 5. There can be no <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> orderly or profitably exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt Believers, while in an unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate and condition. For how can offended perſons after the <hi>firſt &amp; Second Admonition,</hi> tell the Church of an offending perſon his Sin and obſtinacy, and of their dealings with him to bring him to Repentance, as commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. if there be no fixed Church to which they do belong? and how can the cauſe be heard, and the offender dealt withall, according to that charge, by the Church, when there is none? What power have any Believers one over another but by their mutual conſent, and engagement one to another, to give and take Reproofs and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, to and of one another? or how can they call <hi>Offenders</hi> to an account, and require their attendance and ſubjection to their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Laws of Chriſt upon them, unleſſe they are a formed Body, and by virtue of their joynt Relation, not as Believers only, but as united and engaged Believers to one another in that Society? The <hi>Rulers</hi> of a Corporation may not exerciſe Authority, or execute their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Laws on ſuch perſons as have no Relation to them, although they are the Kings ſubjects as well as thoſe that are incorporated: Neither may a thouſand perſons in a place exerciſe Juriſdiction over each other, becauſe they live and often converſe together: Neither have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53333:52"/>many Believers ſuch power over each other, while they walk as ſo many ſingle &amp; individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſons, without a Church-relation to one another, as they might have in a Church-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the forementioned Text evinces. Beſides, (6.) The officers or Miniſters of Chriſt will not be able to diſcharge their work and duty unto them, while they walk looſely and diſorderly.</p>
               <p>For how can they watch and feed them as their own particular Flocks and charge, unleſs there be a fixed Relation between them, and they know where to find them? which they cannot do, unleſſe their flocks be tyed to them, and have mutually choſen each other, (as was ſaid before) the officers are to adminiſter in the name of Chriſt unto them, in an eſpecial manner; and they are to wait on, and ſubmit to their regular miniſtration. Church-Officers muſt officiate in the Church, and all muſt know and work within their own bounds, and to their own charge. So the <hi>Elders</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregated Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> were charged <hi>to feed and watch over</hi> that particular Church, as their own peculiar flock and charge, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. and ſo were the ſeveral <hi>Angels</hi> or Officers of theſe other Churches, mentioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> all which are called <hi>Churches,</hi> which had matter and form. And beſides theſe evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are many other that I could name, if it were needful, and time would permit, which would ſufficiently evince the Truth pleaded for.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall proceed to ſhew how Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhould (by the Holy Ghoſt) form up themſelves into a Church-ſtate, or Temple of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53333:52"/>God, for his Glory and their own profit and Spiritual welfare; or what the form of a Church is, and wherein it lies. <hi>Shew them the form of the Houſe, and the faſhion of it, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and all the Ordinances thereof, Ezek.</hi> 43.11. Firſt, the perſons intending to joyn themſelves together, &amp; to become a Church or Temple of God, for his Name and Glory, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good of their own Souls, and for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly celebration of all the Lords appointments and worſhip in a Church; they ſhould be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> in each others fitneſſe, that they are ſuch as Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>received, Rom.</hi> 15.16. and <hi>Regenerated, Joh.</hi> 3.3. wrought and made ready for it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. that they are united to Chriſt by Faith, and ſanctified to his uſe; Members of Chriſt, and heirs of the Kingdom. I ſay, they ſhould be ſatisfied in a charitable Judgment, that they are ſuch; that ſo they may take each other, and have their hearts kint to one another in Spiritual real Love, as ſuch; and ſo have confidence in and of each other, that they will live together, as ſuch, in their Church-ſtate. <hi>God would not have an Oxe and an Aſſe draw together in ore Yoke,</hi> neither will he have viſible Saints and Sinners joyn together and build him a Goſpel-Church, or holy Temple to dwell in. What have the uncircumcized to do in the Lords Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the circumcized? If Gods houſe muſt be a holy Temple, yea <hi>holyneſſe to God, Iſa.</hi> 63.15. then it muſt conſiſt of, and be formed of holy perſons; for unclean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53333:53"/>perſons cannot make a holy ſpiritual houſe for his glorious preſence. Therefore ſuch as joyn together into a Church-ſtate, ought to know (as well as they can) and be ſatisfied of the fitneſſe and meetneſſe of each other, as well as each perſon of himſelf, for theſe and other Reaſons that might be named.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a competent number of Believers are well ſatisfied in and of each others ſitneſſe to build a holy Temple for God, they ſhould meet together, and ſolemnly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves before God; humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and acknowledge their own weakneſſe, ignorance and unworthyneſſe: for although they may be in a ſenſe meet and worthy, yet becauſe of their indwelling Luſts and actual Trangreſſions, they may ſee matter enough in and by themſelves, to cry out (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did) we are unclean and unworthy, and to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſs of God: ſo alſo to tell God what they are about to do, and entreat him to <hi>ſend forth his Light and Truth</hi> into their hearts, and by his holy Spirit to lead, aſſiſt and guide them in the right way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 61.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. For although they may have (as they have) a plain and perfect Rule before them; to guide them in this weighty matter, yet they may want light in their hearts, to walk by it clearly and exactly, as they ought to do; which the holy Spirit (that hath made them willing by his power) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. will ſupply with his light, upon importunate asking it. Thus <hi>Ezra</hi> did, when concerned in Temple-work, <hi>chapt.</hi> 8.21. and it is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53333:53"/>by <hi>David,</hi> that when God ſhould build up his Church, he would do it upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. And as they ſhould pray for light and counſel in their hearts, from the holy Ghoſt, (who is and will be owned and accounted the chief Agent in the work of building Goſpel-Churches; as in preparing Materials, making them willing, guiding and directing them in the work) ſo that God would vouchſafe them his preſence, own and bleſſe them in their Church-ſtate; ratifie and confirm the labour of their hands, and proſper them to his Glory, &amp; their own edification &amp; comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When this is done, and their hearts are warmed with the preſence of God, and their minds enlightned with the Spirits Beams of Light, ſhining in upon them, in anſwer to their Prayers; and their hearts thereby faſter knit to each other in Love, as to the living Members of Chriſt; then they ſhould declare to each other their free, full and cordial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of, and ſatisfaction in one another; expreſſe to one another their real, hearty and joynt Reſolutions, purpoſes and Intentions (by the help of God) to live and walk together as a Church of Chriſt, in the celebration of all the ordinances of Chriſt in the Church: and engage, covenant and promiſe to take upon themſelves the practice and obſervation of all the Laws of Chriſt, and duties one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that ſtate and Relation; <hi>taking hold of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> accepting the Lord Jeſus for their Lord, Head and Saviour, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves unto him, and profeſſing their unfained ſubjection to him and all his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53333:54"/>Rules, Laws and Orders, and that <hi>they will ſubmit themſelves one to another in the fear of God, Eph.</hi> 5.21. as he hath commanded them. And which may be confirmed to one another, by giving each other the <hi>right hands of fellowſhip, Gal.</hi> 2 9.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the formal conſtituting cauſe of a Church, or Temple of God; and I know no other: but ſome there muſt be; and I think to this agree ſeveral Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that (if rightly underſtood) amounts to as much as aforeſaid. Thus the Iſraelites became a Church; God propounded to them, what he would have them obſerve and do, and accordingly the whole congregation received what was ſaid, and engaged to do and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what God required of them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3. <hi>And Moſes came and told the people all the words of the Lord; and all the people anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one voice, and ſaid, All the words which the Lord hath ſaid, will we do:</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9.—14. This was freely and voluntarily done by them, and thereby they became a Church, and were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly admitted unto all the worſhip and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof, and God accepted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of what they had done, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27, 28. <hi>Go thou near and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and we will hear it, and do it. And the Lord heard the voice of your words when ye ſpake unto me, and the Lord ſaid unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this People, which they have ſpoken unto thee: They have well ſaid, all that they have ſpoken.</hi> And the like proceedure we find amongſt them after
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53333:54"/>they had corrupted themſelves and their Church-ſtate, broken their ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and departed from God; and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their ſo doing, and of their duty to God and one another, they return to God and renew their Church-engagement, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 24.16, to 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> So in <hi>Aſa</hi> his daies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.10, to 16. <hi>v.</hi> and <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. and 10. <hi>chapt.</hi> And ſomewhat like to this we find in the New Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>And this they did, not as we hoped, but firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God:</hi> And the Apoſtle minds the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> of their <hi>profeſſed Subjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. which it ſeems was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly done at their congregating and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching; for then is the time of doing it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and publiquely, for the ſatisfaction of one another, when they openly and avowedly take upon themſelves by mutual conſent and agreement, as an incorporated body, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt together. To the ſame purpoſe alſo, is that paſſage in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> The Apoſtle writes to them as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregated Church, and tells them that they had received Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, which was ſolemnly done, (in all probability) at their embodying. And this ſeems to be ſpoken of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me: thoſe that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. And indeed, it is clear to me, that the nature of the thing requires it, were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53333:55"/>there no Scriptures to countenance it. For they are (as hath been ſaid) called and compared to Houſes, Temples, Corporations, Cities, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and to voluntary, not meer natural Relations, they muſt of neceſſity, be knit and formed into ſuch a State and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by their own free choice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, to live and walk together as ſuch: And this action of Believers is of, and by the Lord, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>were added,</hi> and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> namely, to the particular congregational Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So that upon the whole I infer, that Believers ought ſo to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together into Churches, as hath been ſhewed; which I hope I may affirm and aſſert without reflection on, or offence to ſuch as are otherwiſe minded, if any ſuch there be that fear God.</p>
               <p>Believers being thus built and formed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are now become a holy Temple of God; and are accordingly owned by him as ſuch; and now they are the ſeat and ſubject of all the Laws, and Ordinances, power and Authority, that Jeſus Chriſt hath given to, and for his Churches uſe and benefit: I mean they, or this Church ſo formed and built, have all theſe eſſentially, though not formally, until Chriſt ſet one or more teaching Elders in it, for the orderly uſing and managing of that his power and Authority given to the Church. Yet I ſay, (I think) that it doth eſſentially reſide in them, as the firſt ſubject of the <hi>Keys;</hi> for I find the keys given unto, them for the uſe and behoof of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18, 19. which ſaid
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53333:55"/>power of the Keys, cannot be given only to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor unto the univerſal or Catholick Church, that it ſhould uſe them as ſuch, for that is impoſſible; but they were given to particular Churches, as formed up of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, namely, to ſuch as could have matters brought to, and be received and heard by them, from an offended Brother, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. and ſuch a Church is here meant, as had power to deal with a ſinning member, in caſe of obſtinacy, and therefore the Catholick Church (as ſuch) is nor there intended.</p>
               <p>Now this Church ſpoken of hath power to elect and call ſuch perſons (out from amongſt themſelves, to uſe and exert the power and authority of Jeſus Chriſt already given them, and Miniſtring to them in the Name of the Lord) as they judge the Lord Jeſus hath fitted, qualified for, given to, and ſent amongſt them, and inveſted with Authority and abilities for their Good. I ſay, they have power to elect and call ſuch to office power over them, in the Lord, and that they ought with all convenient ſpeed, after they are built up, to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe till that be done, they cannot orderly and regularly adminiſter or receive the Seals of the Covenant: for all cannot exert and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that power that doth eſſentially reſide in themſelves, as a Church; neither can any private Member, while ſuch; and therefore it muſt be done by <hi>Officers,</hi> or one in Office, that is called, ſet apart and wholly dedicated to the work of the Miniſtry amongſt them. <hi>Therefore they may and ought, to look out from among themſelves,</hi> and call to Office, ſuch as they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53333:56"/>judge Chriſt hath ſent them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord Jeſus hath (by his Sovereign Authority) given to his Church, <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Ruling Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> All which Officers are inveſted with different power, and entruſted with different works in the Church. Now the Teaching-ruling Officers, have ſeveral names and appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations given them, according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts and branches of their work in the Church; As Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, Biſhops, Guides. All theſe names are given to the ſame Perſons and Officers in the Church. Sometimes they are called <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Eph.</hi> 4.11. ſometimes <hi>Elders,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. ſometimes <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Overſeers, Act.</hi> 20.28. ſometimes <hi>Guides, Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. and they are of the ſame ſort, order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; their work, office and power the ſame: for although they have different names in ſound, yet not of work, power and Authority in the Church. The perſons are the ſame, their office, power and authority the ſame,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53333:56"/>and their work the ſame. The Scripture doth no where give one ordinary teaching Officer more power and Authority than another, or ſet one ſort of Teaching Elders over another ſort, nor give them diſtinct and different work to do in the Church; but ſo, as that whatever power or work a Biſhop hath in the Church to exerciſe and do, the ſame hath an Elder or Paſtor alſo. Hath a Biſhop power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>to command and Teach?</hi> ſo hath an Elder too; hath a Biſhop (I mean one of Chriſts making) the ordering of Church-matters, and managing the diſcipline thereof? ſo hath an Elder alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. for they are the ſame.</p>
               <p>Beſides Teaching Elders, the Lord Jeſus hath given and appointed meer ruling Elders to his Church alſo, for the well-being, peace and eſtabliſhment of the Church, and to aſſiſt and help the Teaching ruling Elders, in looking after &amp; taking care of the concernments of the Church, called <hi>Helps,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. and they are expreſly called <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Teaching ruling Elders, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 5.17. and <hi>Helps, Governments,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. it is ſaid, <hi>he that ruleth let him do it with diligence,</hi> and diſtinguiſheth them from Treaching, Miniſtring and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rulers, (for Teachers have the power of rule and diſcipline as well as the meer ruling Elders) in 7, 8. <hi>verſes.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks not there of different <hi>Offices</hi> in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (though that is a Truth) but of different perſons and Officers; for ſays he, <hi>let the Teachers wait on their Teaching, Miniſtring, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53333:57"/>that is, as it is their great and principal work, (as indeed it is) and therefore to eaſe them a little of the ruling part of their work, and that they may the more fixedly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend unto, and perform that other part of their work, namely, to teach and Miniſter in the Church, the Lord Jeſus hath appointed ſome to attend only (ordinarily) to the work of ruling, to keep all in order in the Church; and therefore charges them to <hi>do it with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Rom.</hi> 12.8. Beſides theſe, the Lord hath given <hi>Deacons</hi> to his Church alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. to 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. for another kind of work, namely to <hi>attend Tables,</hi> to look after the poor, and provide for them; to diſpoſe of the Churches diſtributions and charity, for the profit of the whole, and relief of the poor of the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, They muſt be furniſhed with Miniſterial Gifts for their work; namely, ſuch as Chriſt promiſed, and aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give unto men for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and which he received of the Father for them, even then, when he <hi>gave all things into his hand, Joh.</hi> 3.35. which are abſolutely neceſſary for all that take upon them the great work of the Miniſtry, and the care and charge of Souls, or to overſee and edifie the Body of Chriſt. Theſe Gifts are ſpiritual which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not from men, but from Chriſt their Lord, <hi>who ſends them as his Stewards into his houſhold,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53333:57"/>to give them meat in due ſeaſon, Matth.</hi> 24. as his ſervants into his vineyard to dreſſe, prune and order it, to keep and water it, for his uſe, that it may bring forth fruit to his Glory. And intending to imploy and make ſuch uſe of them there, he enriches all that he ſends with his own Miniſterial Gifts. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 10, 11, 12. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto men. He that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Paſtours and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Here is an account of his Gifts, and the perſon receiving them, and alſo the end for which. To the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. as you may read there at large, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end: Where you have an account of the ſeveral Gifts themſelves, which are called <hi>Spiritual, verſ.</hi> 1, 2. The Authour or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Doner</hi> of them, 7. as alſo the end of the Spirits giving them unto men, and the place where they ſhould be exerciſed and laid out, 7, 28. and in other <hi>verſes</hi> there. Theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Gifts are not given to all Believers, becauſe they are not intended nor called to the work and Office of the Miniſtery in the Church, but they are intended and given to them, whom Jeſus Chriſt ſends into his Church, and enclines the Churches hearts to call and accept them, for their Officers and Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As they muſt be gifted with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Spiritual Gifts, ſo they muſt be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53333:58"/>alſo with ſpecial ſaving Grace, for the ſpiritual and evangelical diſcharge of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial work in the Church; or elſe they will never be <hi>able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, although they may be of the Letter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. They muſt be <hi>called out of darkneſſe, into the marvellous ſaving light of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and be the <hi>Children of Light, Eph.</hi> 5.8. before they can hold forth indeed the light of the Goſpel and grace of Chriſt unto others. They muſt be firſt taught of God themſelves, before they can ſpiritually teach others; and be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored in Chriſts School, before they will be wiſe Builders up of the Body of Chriſt, in the <hi>Myſteries of his Kingdome, Mark</hi> 4.11. They muſt firſt have the Spirit of God in their own hearts, <hi>to make them wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> before they can make others wiſe unto Salvation. They muſt not learn their Leſſons without, in mens or Gods Books, but they muſt alſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and be able to read the Goſpel within, that they preach to others. They muſt firſt learn, and be acquainted themſelves with and in the right way to Heaven, before they can be good <hi>Pilots</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> of others thither. They muſt firſt be quickened and enlivened themſelves, by &amp; with the Life of Jeſus, before they can claim a right to the Miniſtry of Chriſt in his Church, or hold forth and rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the word of Life to others. Many think that Grace is not neceſſary in a Miniſter, or for the Miniſtry, where are miniſterial Gifts, and (as they ſay) a blameleſſe converſation; but ſurely, the ſpecial Grace, and Spirit of Chriſt are the only neceſſary and uſeful
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53333:58"/>things, (if I may ſo ſpeak) for the fitting and qualifying a Goſpel-Miniſter, a Church-Officer and Guide. But undoubtedly it is a miſtake; for how can they bring out of their Treaſury, things new and old, for the profit of men, if there be none laid in? <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treaſure, bringeth forth evil things, Matth.</hi> 12.35. <hi>And men cannot gather Grapes of Thornes, and figs of Thiſtles, Matth.</hi> 7.16. And what are Hypocrites, but ſuch? Are they not in darkneſſe, and doth not the Lord Jeſus call the Scribes and Phariſees, and Doctors of the Law, <hi>Fools and Blind,</hi> notwithſtanding their great Gifts? Are not all unregenerate and graceleſſe perſons, <hi>ravening Wolves,</hi> although covered with Sheeps-skins? and doth not Chriſt caution his Sheep againſt them, and charge them to take heed and beware of them? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. And when Chriſt ſends forth labourers into his Vineyard, ſays he to them, <hi>I ſend you forth, as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves? Matth.</hi> 10.16 Chriſt doth not ſay, I ſend forth Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, to convert, nouriſh and build up my Sheep unto eternal life. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Miniſters muſt not only preach to men from the head (the ſubject of meer Gifts) but from their hearts alſo; from ſtrong affections, tender bowels of compaſſion, and ſincere Love to Souls; which they cannot do, until they are made new Creatures, holy and gracious men. For how can they love and pity others Souls, who have no love and pity for their own? and how can they affectionately <hi>perſwade
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53333:59"/>men,</hi> who know not experimentally <hi>the terror of the Lord?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. How can ſuch open the Myſtery and ſpirituality of the Goſpel unto men, who were never taught it themſelves? and how can they ſo preach the Goſpel of Life, who are yet dead in Sins themſelves, as to enliven others? Therefore all the Miniſters that Jeſus Chriſt impowers and ſends into his Churches, in ſpecial love and mercy, he firſt graceth with his ſpecial light &amp; life, joyns and unites them to himſelf, and puts ſome of his own Image, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and qualities upon them, before he ſends them, or will be with them, and bleſſe them. Can or will ſuch take care of the Church of Chriſt as ſuch, to water and break the Bread of Life unto them, who take no care about their own Souls, nor care what becomes of them? And if Jeſus Chriſt will have none but real hearted Believers, and living Members of his Body, in his Churches, (as hath been ſhewed) then certainly he will not allow or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of <hi>Graceleſſe, and unregenerate Guides and Overſeers</hi> in them; and if his Churches are holy Temples appointed for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and reſidence, his Glory and delight, (as they are, as hath been ſhewed) then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, he will not have <hi>carnal and unbelieving Stewards</hi> in them, to manage all the affairs and concernments of them? And if all his Laws and Ordinances, which he hath given to his Churches, be holy and ſpiritual, (as they are) and Church-Officers, (I mean the Paſtors and Elders) are to be his mouths to them, and the Churches mouths to him, and to adminiſter his holy and Spiritual matters and things in his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53333:59"/>Name, to his Glory and the Churches Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al profit; then ſurely, they ought to be holy and ſpiritual Men. For will he own ſuch for his Miniſters as have no acquaintance with him, or Relation to him; who have no peculiar love for him, nor dependance on him; who have not hearts to obey him, and make him the great end of their work; and who never received the Truth in the love of it into their own hearts? Will the holy and loving Head and Husband of his Church, ſet over them Chriſtleſſe, lifeleſſe, and graceleſſe men, (as all unregenerate perſons are) who neither fear or love him, or his Church ſincerely, to watch over them, and impart his ſecrets and counſels to them? ſurely no. And therefore they muſt be fitted and qualifyed with ſaving Graces, as well as Miniſterial Gifts, for office, power and work in the Church of Chriſt. I might argue this point very largely and copiouſly, did I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a large diſcourſe, as I do not, but to uſe all poſſible brevity, in all things, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſent to conſideration, in the whole of the diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they ſhould not only have, and be qualified with ſpiritual Gifts, and ſpecial Grace, <hi>but with the holy Ghoſt alſo.</hi> It is not ſuch Gifts and Grace, that will ſufficiently qualifie and enable men to diſcharge their miniſterial work in the Church, without the Spirit. They will not be <hi>willing, ready, nor apt to teach,</hi> without the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. Neither will they be able <hi>to divide the word aright,</hi> without the Spirit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53333:60"/>hath Jeſus Chriſt promiſed to be with them in an eſpecial manner, in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial work, (who are his Miniſters) <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15, and 16. <hi>chapters.</hi> They muſt preach and pray by the Spirit; watch over, feed and water the Church by the Spirit, for their Gifts and Graces can do nothing in this matter, but by the Spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Spirit is promiſed to help them; to teach, warm, ſtrengthen and quicken them: to comfort, lead and Guide them; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt ſends any <hi>Shepherds</hi> into his Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, (in love and mercy) he ſends them, and they come there with the holy Ghoſt in their hearts. Look over <hi>Pauls Epiſtles</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and to the particular Churches, and you may find this Truth confirmed. Thus God promiſed his New Teſtament Churches long before they ſubſiſted, or had a being in the World, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And I will give you Paſtors according to mine own heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> It is the Spirit that makes men able Miniſters of the New Teſtament and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. not created Grace and Gifts only. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpake the word of God, as the Spirit gave them utterance, Acts</hi> 2.4. and as they were <hi>moved</hi> (or carried forth) <hi>by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. A Temple of God, <hi>is built by the Spirit for the habitation of God, Eph.</hi> 2.21, 22. all the Laws and Ordinances of the Temple are given forth by the Spirit from Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. all the Grace and Gifts beſtowed on men, are by the Spirit; their Life, ſtrength and ſucceſſe is by and from the Spirit: their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53333:60"/>work and authority in the Church, is given them by the Spirit; and therefore the holy Spirit will accompany and abide with his own Miniſters there.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>They muſt be qualified and adorned with ſingular Spirits, with excellent and choice Spirits and frames of Heart:</hi> they ſhould excel others in ſuch qualities and virtues as theſe. Firſt, <hi>they ſhould be ſingular and excelling in knowledge and Spiritual underſtanding,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the difference of things that differ, and to <hi>judge of Spiritual things Spiritually,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. They ſhould abound in heavenly wiſdome and prudence, in conformity to their Lord Chriſt. Secondly, They ſhould be eminent and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>in Goſpel ſimplicity and ſincerity too,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They ſhould be eminent and ſingular <hi>in Humility;</hi> in all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humbleneſs of mind and converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1.—6. Of all men in the world, they muſt not be proud and lofty in their hearts and carriages, but <hi>meek and lowly, Mat.</hi> 11.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 25. Fourthly, They muſt be eminent and ſingular <hi>in Gentleneſſe and peaceableneſſe;</hi> they muſt not <hi>brawl</hi> nor <hi>ſtrive,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. Fifthly, They muſt be eminent <hi>in Self-denial and curbing the Fleſh;</hi> keeping under carnal, worldly ſelf, and croſſing the <hi>deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> Sixthly, They muſt be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſingular <hi>in patience and contentation,</hi> they muſt not be <hi>ſoon angry,</hi> or moved to paſſion and wrath, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Seventhly, They muſt be eminent and ſingular <hi>in a ſober, ſerious, holy chearfulneſſe and ſweetneſſe, pleaſantneſſe and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53333:61"/>affability;</hi> they muſt not be of vain and frothy Spirits, nor of froward, ſullen, lumpiſh and ſad carriages and deportments: for theſe things are hateful in all Chriſtians, much more are they ſo in ſuch as are ſet in the Church, for lights and Examples to them. This is a part of that good behaviour, the Apoſtle ſays, they muſt be endued withal, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. Eightly, They muſt be eminent and ſingular <hi>in zeal and fervency</hi> alſo. For if private Chriſtians ſhould abound in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. then much more ſhould the Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. Ninthly, They muſt be eminent and ſingular in <hi>Love, pity and bowels of compaſſion to Souls;</hi> they muſt not be of hard and inſenſible Spirits, but full of tender earning bowels towards their flocks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. So was Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> towards all ſorts of men they had to do withall, (excepting obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sinners, who trampled pearles under their feet) and ſo muſt Miniſters be now. <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted,</hi> (ſays Paul) <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Tenthly, They muſt be eminent and ſingular <hi>in Heavenly mindedneſſe;</hi> they muſt not be covetous nor greedy after worldly things; which the Apoſtle calls <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. They muſt declare as much as poſſible, that in the midſt of earthly enjoyments, they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, and live above them. <hi>They are holy men of God, and therefore muſt flee thoſe things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. and follow after heaverly. Eleventhly,</hi> They muſt be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and eminent <hi>in gavity and ſolidity:</hi> they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53333:61"/>muſt not be vain, light and frothy talkers, and of fooliſh jeſting Spirits and carriages, but grave and ſerious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> They ſhould be <hi>apt to teach,</hi> ſet forward and entertain holy and profitable diſcourſes, as they have opportunity; which will not now be eaſily found, I fear, amongſt profeſſors. However, they ſhould be alwaies ready, apt and willing to do their duty, although others are not to do theirs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> They ſhould be <hi>well armed with Wiſdome, Faith and Patience,</hi> to endure and ſtand faſt againſt all oppoſitions and Temptations, and to bear up under all the great diſcouragements they may meet withall from friends and foes; for they will be tryed by both. Hence the Apoſtle charges <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>follow after Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. ſays he, <hi>be thou an Example to the Believers, in Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore they ſhould come to their work well armed and fenced with Faith and Patience: for it will be tryed to the utmoſt, as ſad experience ſhews. <hi>Fourteently,</hi> They ſhould be eminent and ſingular <hi>in ſetting up high and noble ends in their eies and hearts,</hi> in their office and work in the Church. The great motives, aims and ends of their hearts and Souls, ſhould be to pleaſe and honour Jeſus Chriſt, their Lord and Maſter, and to edifie and profit his Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. Theſe are ſome of the neceſſary qualifications, that all Paſtors of Churches ſhould bring with them, and labour to grow and encreaſe in them, when they are there.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53333:62"/>
               <p>Fifthly, They muſt be qualified <hi>with holy and blameleſſe converſations and carriages</hi> alſo: Theſe are in part deſcribed in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. and elſewhere in the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and other <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And it muſt needs be ſo, namely, that they be ſingular <hi>in all manner of holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlyneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>But exerciſe thy ſelf unto Godlineſſe;</hi> for they are appointed and ſet in the Church to be their Lights and Guides, to be <hi>Examples</hi> to Believers, and all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They will by blamable walkings, more diſhonour Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel; more grieve and afflict the hearts of good Men; ſcandalize and harden the hearts of evil men, than a hundred times as many private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and pull great reproach and comtempt upon the Miniſtry of Chriſt in his Churches. They are more eyed and obſerved, and are nearer Jeſus Chriſt than others are, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things are expected from them than from others. Therefore they ſhould ſhine forth in all Grace, and be found (though not without their failings) in the practice of every good Work, as men, Chriſtians and Miniſters of Chriſt. It is not enough for them that they be not ſuch and ſuch negative profeſſors, but they muſt be ſuch, and ſo in practical holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They muſt not only abſtain from that which is evil and forbidden, but they muſt do that which is good and commended; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cannot be blameleſſe. But if they are indeed of ſuch Spirits (as aforeſaid) they will be of holy and blameleſſe converſations,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53333:62"/>and walk as Goſpel, real, true Lights &amp; Guides before all: but if they want theſe heart and internal qualifications, they will not long (if at all) be blameleſſe walkers. If they are of proud, peeviſh, croſs and fretful; of <hi>ſowre, angry</hi> and <hi>wrathful</hi> Tempers and carriages, they are not blameleſſe. If they are of <hi>hot, teſty, fiery, raſh</hi> and <hi>quarrelſome</hi> Tempers and Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they are not blameleſſe. If they are <hi>Back biters and Defamers</hi> of men, or <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Receivers</hi> of evil reports againſt good men, they are not blameleſſe. If they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteous worldly perſons in their words and deeds, they are not blameleſſe. If they are exceſſive in their cloaths, houſes, eating or drinking, they are not blameleſſe. If they are cenſorious and raſh Judges of others, they are not blameleſſe. If they are <hi>cheaters</hi> or <hi>detainers</hi> of others dues from them, they are not blameleſſe. If they are vain and light perſons, and given much to frothy idle talk and jeſtings, or to Idleneſs, they are not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. If they are careleſſe of, and negligent in relative duties, and the worſhip of God in their families, they are not blameleſſe. If they are not diligent in their callings, and works, but are addicted to walk abroad, ſleep, or otherwaies ſpend away their pretious time, vainly, and unprofitably, they are not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. I might inſtance in many more, but that I ſtudy brevity, as well as Truth. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt muſt not only be free from the practice of ſuch and ſuch Sins, but they muſt be eminent and ſingular in the practice of all duties incumbent on them, towards God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53333:63"/>and men alſo, (unavoidably infirmities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.)</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They muſt alſo have, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>natural Gifts,</hi> as ability of body, and the <hi>Gift of utterance.</hi> For although a man may have a great ſtock of Graces, Gifts, and Truths laid up in his head and Heart, yet if he want abilities of Body or ſpeech to utter, &amp; plainly declare them unto others, how can he profit the Church, or miniſter to their edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? (which is the great end of thoſe Gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Miniſtry.) Therefore they muſt not be only qualified within, but without alſo; they muſt be able to <hi>ſpeak as they ought, Eph.</hi> 6.20. as well as to judge as they ought to judge of, and underſtand divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Sevently, <hi>They muſt be ſound in the Faith</hi> too, For if they be leavened with corrupt Doctrine, and their Faith and Judgments tainted with it, they may eaſily corrupt and leaven the Church of Chriſt, by ſowing ſuch <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>ſtinking Weeds,</hi> as all the men in the world will never be able to pull out again. <hi>A little leaven,</hi> (of corrupt Doctrine) <hi>leavens the whole Lump, Gal.</hi> 5.9. And when once falſe doctrines are got into the Head, they will quickly defile and corrupt the whole heart and converſation. And therefore to prevent ſuch evils in the Churches, the Apoſtles laboured exceedingly with the Churches, and aſſoon as they perceived any Tares of corrupt doctrine ſown in the Churches, they preſently endeavoured the pulling of them up, and weeding of them out, either by preaching or writing. And <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:53333:63"/>charged <hi>Titus</hi> to ſee that Teachers were ſound in the Faith and Doctrines of the Goſpel, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9.13. and that they <hi>ſpeak ſound Doctrines, chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. that they were of <hi>ſound Minds,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and alſo, <hi>that they hold faſt the form of ſound Words, verſ.</hi> 13. and alſo wiſhes all corrupt and unſound Teachers <hi>cut off, Gal.</hi> 5.12. Therefore they muſt not be erroneous in their Faith and Judgments, but ſound in the Faith of the Goſpel, that are (together with the aforeſaid particulars) rightly qualified Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt. And you may be ſure, that Jeſus Chriſt hath more care of, and reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name, Goſpel, and Churches, which <hi>he hath purchaſed with his Blood,</hi> than to ſet over them erroneous and corrupt Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Humane learning is not to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſp ſed in a Miniſter,</hi> (as it is too much by ſome, who know not the good of it) for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Word and Spirit of God can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prepare &amp; qualifie a man for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry without it, yet experience ſhews, that it is ſingularly uſeful to holy men, in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Work. It helps to make them more able men, though not Chriſtians: it is uſefull to their heads (who know how to uſe it) if not to their Hearts: it is a good ſervant to wait on Divinity, though a bad maſter when it is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above it, (as to many ſhamefully and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do.) It is well know, that we come to the knowledge of the Spirit and myſtery of divine Truths, by the letter wherein it is held forth; and we come to underſtand the mind and intention of a Superior, by the words
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53333:64"/>he ſpeaks to us: ſo that if we underſtand not his words, we cannot know his mind and will, or what he would have us believe, do, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And is it not the ſame with reſpect to the Word of God? how can we know his mind and will concerning us, but by his Word? and how by his Word or Words, except we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their ſenſe, meaning and ſignification, what they do import and hold forth to us? and can any deny but that humane learning is uſeful towards the helping of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to find out the ſenſe, meaning and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſign of them? It is in vain to ſay, that the holy Spirit will do that well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humane learning: for did the holy Spirit ever teach an Engliſh man to underſtand <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> (the Tongues wherein the Scriptures of God were written) without humane help? or can an Engliſh man becauſe he underſtands Engliſh, therefore underſtand the Scriptures in theſe Tongues? what if the moſt of men that are learned do abuſe it? ſhall it therefore be deſpiſed? will any wiſe man deſpiſe wine, that good creature of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men abuſe it? and ſhall we deſpiſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, that good Creature of God, becauſe it is abuſed? It is given to help and perfect men, and may be exceedingly uſefull to them in publique ſervice for God and his Church, as well as for a State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and ſuch as are greatned and lifted up in their own conceit, ſlight and deſpiſe others who are not as learned as themſelves, (as they ſuppoſe) do thereby divert it from its real uſe and end, turn it into ſin and ſhame,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53333:64"/>and abuſe it as much as drunkards do good wine, and they ſhall at laſt <hi>rue</hi> for it. But what then? ſhall learning be ſlighted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed? God forbid. How ſhould we have known the Scriptures, had there not been learned men to tranſlate them into our native Language? ſurely you that deſpiſe humane learning, ſhould-rather bleſſe God all your daies, that he was pleaſed to give it unto men for your good, and for the propagation of his Goſpel. And I ſay further, that if humane learning be deſirable and uſefull unto men, then it cannot be prejudicial, but very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto the Miniſters of the Goſpel: for I think, that they will and may make as bleſſed and holy improvements of it, as other men can do. I find (indeed) no ſmall error on both hands; the unlearned in contemning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing it, as a vain uſeleſſe thing, eſpecially in a Miniſter of the Goſpel; and the learned in magnifying it above the skies, ſetting it on the Throne, and the holy Spirit, and grace at the foot-ſtool; diſdaining and contemning the unlearned, and making it one of the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary qualifications of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>when indeed, the Scripture doth not:</hi> Which with other abuſes of it, by ſome, hath brought it under Reproach. But yet I ſay ſtill, the fault is not in humane learning, but in the men that abuſe it: And therefore let it be loved, uſed and reſpected in its place. Let thoſe that have it ſee they uſe it well, and carry themſelves more humbly with it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others; and thoſe that have it not, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſpeaking evilly and reproachfully of that which they underſtand not.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53333:65"/>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>They muſt be qualified with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in their own hearts and conſciences, that they are moved by, and called of God to take upon them the work of the Miniſtry, and that in ſuch a place;</hi> that they may go forth and enter upon it in Faith, hope and obedience, as they ought to do. Without this, all the reſt of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid qualifications will not ſerve the turn; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they can probably conclude upon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grounds that they hear their Lord ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) unto them, Go you into ſuch a vineyard and work; lay out and improve my Talents there, in ſuch a place, with ſuch a People. Which ſaid ſatisfaction, will be the reſult of many ſighs, tears and cries; for ſo great a mercy will not be gotten (ordinarily) upon eaſier Terms, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2, 3. For it is certain, that men may <hi>run before they are ſent of God, Jer.</hi> 23.21. and it may be with a good intention too, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſeemed to have in offering Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> in medling with the <hi>Ark,</hi> as he did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. and men may judge them meet and ready for the work; yea call and give them importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate invitations to it, and yet God may not ſend them, nor bid them go. I think, that they may have the loud, ſtrong calls of men, to miniſter to them, when God is not in it. Now it is probable, that there are ſome men, who are endowed with excellent Miniſterial Gifts; who mind and concern themſelves moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not altogether with their external call from men, and do not once ſeriouſly conſider, nor ask the queſtion, if God ſay ſo too, or no; but away they go, without the internal call
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53333:65"/>or motion of the Spirit. And truely theſe are likely to ſucceed accordingly. I fear that God will ſav to them as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.32. <hi>They ſhall not profit this People.</hi> They are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and without the Lord, and follow the voice of men and their own natural Genius, being drawn by ſome worldly allurements, but they ſhall not proſper, unleſſe they repent of their diſorderly walking. <hi>David</hi> would not go and poſſeſs the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until he had asked it, and received anſwer from God, that he ſhould, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and when God bid him go, he would firſt know where he ſhould go, before he durſt adventure to go to <hi>Hebron;</hi> although he was long before anointed King, and he had a great multitude of the Iſraelites with him, that doubtleſs had ſtrongly invited him to the Government; yet he could not go and take it upon him, until God ſent him, and bid him go. (2) There are others, who do wait for a call from God, to go forth to the work, but hang in doubt whether they ſhould go, or whether God hath anſwered them, and theſe go forth uncomfortably and in part unwillingly. They are loath to tarry Gods time for a clear and ſatisfactory anſwer, and ſo go on with many doubts, fears and ſcruples of conſcience: there being a war and conteſt in their hearts, between ſhall I, or ſhall I not: Whereas if they would pray importunately, and wait patiently the Lords time to anſwer, and ſatisfy them, they might go forth in peace with the bleſſings and preſence of God. (3) There are ſome, who faſt, pray, and cry, wait and watch for Anſwers, and will not ſtir
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53333:66"/>until they have an Anſwer of peace and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from God; (as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) and then they ſet forward with all poſſible chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs, hope and confidence: and theſe are the perſons <hi>that ſhall finiſh the courſe of their Miniſtry with Joy,</hi> and proſper in their work; <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. that will do it <hi>with Joy and not with Grief, Heb.</hi> 13.17. certainly, this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is abſolutely neceſſary, namely, that they have a good meaſure of aſſurance, that God hath called and ſent them into his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to work there, as his Stewards and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. For how can they preach as his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, except they know that they are ſent by him, &amp; have his Authority impowring them? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 15. the ſervants ſtood and waited for a miſſion from their Lord, and would not go, until they had it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. And there are many Reaſons for it; I will but name a few. (1) Becauſe the work they have to do, is the Lords, not their own: and what have they to do to medle with it, until their Lord calls &amp; ſends them? otherwiſe he may ſay unto them, friends, what do you here in my Vineyard about my work and concernments? did I call or ſend you hither, or rather did you not come upon your own will and pleaſure? (2) Becauſe the Churches in which they work, are the Lords: and he will have his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and deſigned ſervants in his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and houſholds, and none elſe, he alots and appoints the ſeveral works of his ſervants and the places where they ſhall work, and leaves it not to their own wills &amp; choice, but as directed and guided, moved and carried forth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53333:66"/>by him. As God ſent <hi>Paul to the Gentiles, and Peter to the Jews,</hi> ſo doth God now ſend ſuch a man to ſuch a Church, and another to another Church, to adminiſter there, and if the great Lord and Maſter ſhould find ſuch a Servant here, as he did intend for an other place, how will he anſwer his being out of his own place? (3) Becauſe their going forth and labouring in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> muſt be <hi>obediential Acts.</hi> They muſt do it, not becauſe it is their own will and choice, but the Lords, and that in obedience unto him. And how can they do that, except they have ſome good aſſurance that the Lord hath ſent and called them? How can they obey the voice of the Lord, when they are not well ſatisfied, that they have heard and felt the Lord ſpeaking to their hearts, in anſwer unto prayers? (4) Becauſe they muſt go forth and labour, in dependence on, and expectation of him; to be with them: to help and aſſiſt them; to bleſſe and proſper them, to crown and ſucceed their endeavours, and to provide for them. Now, how can they do ſo, unleſſe they know that God hath ſent and imployed them in his work? (5) They muſt go forth and labour, <hi>in hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine acceptance,</hi> alſo. For God hath promiſed to accept the commanded work and ſervice of his people, in obedience to his holy will. Therefore they muſt know that they are doing of, or about to do their Lords work, when, and where he would have them. (6) Becauſe they are promiſed a reward; and they ought to believe and look for it, onely in the way of their duty, and no where elſe. And
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53333:67"/>how can any expect a reward for doing that, which for ought they know, is not their duty, at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, in ſuch a way? (7) Becauſe they ought to bleſſe, thank and praiſe God for imploying them in his ſo great work and ſervice, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. which they cannot do unleſſe they are ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, of the Lords calling them to it.</p>
               <p>Tenthly. As they ſhould be ſatisfied in their own Souls, of the Lords calling and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into his Vineyard, ſo the Church to which they are ſent ſhould be ſatisfied of the ſame likewiſe; and they ſhould find great and real acceptance in each others hearts. The Church ſhould own and receive them, as ſent by, and from Jeſus Chriſt unto them, to do his work, and adminiſter his holy Laws and Ordinances to them; and that as great and promiſed mercies and bleſſings for their good. Their union, communion and Spiritual Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be founded in Love and ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections one to another, and grounded upon real ſatisfaction in, and cordial acceptance one of an another, as married together by Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo make one intire body, and Temple. Theſe are no light and inſignificant matters, but very great and weighty (matters) indeed: They put themſelves into each others hands, and become one anothers in the Lord; in which ſtate and condition they muſt abide, and live together, until the Lord ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them by ſome extraordinary providence. For till then, they cannot part one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor leave each other, no not with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53333:67"/>conſents, at their own will and pleaſure; becauſe they were joyned together by the will of God, as the chief and principal doer of it; and therefore no lower will and power can diſſolve the knot, then that which at firſt did knit it. Theſe Miniſters muſt go and take up with the Church, as ſent to them by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Church muſt own and receive them as Chriſts choice and gracious gift unto them. And therefore they ſhould be fully ſatisfied in each other, and find deep real Love. cordial acceptance and room in one anothers hearts: reſolving to live, walk and continue together, in Love and Faithfulneſs, and in the conſtant practice of all duties to God and one another, before they do unite and engage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Church-Relation. For if they do not become one Holy Church and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon the account of Jeſus Chriſt his joyning them, or calling them to own, accept and chuſe one another in that Relation: If they be not congregated and united together, by, and upon the principle of Goſpel-Love and Affection; and if they enter not into, and continue in that ſtate and Relation, Union and Communion together, in purſuance of the will and call of Chriſt, and in obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they are never likely to continue long together in peace and comfort; to have God dwell in, and walk with them, or to thrive and proſper. They may be able to make a comfortable Judgment of the Lords calling and joyning them together in love and mercy, thus; or by theſe things. Firſt, if the Glory of the Lord Jeſus &amp; their own Spiritual profit
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53333:68"/>and edification, lay deep in their hearts, and are their great and only ends in their uniting and joyning together. 2. If they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly and importunately asked counſel and conduct of God: committed the whole to his choice, and diſpoſal, to make up, or hinder the match between them, as he pleaſed: and did indeed reſign up their wills and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wholly unto his Wiſdome and Sovereign pleaſure, to order, and determine them and for them, as he ſhould think fit, in order to the ſaid ends: and in their Prayers together and apart, have ſtood in an even ballance, waiting and expecting what the Lord would ſay and do in the caſe, to and for them. 3. And if after they have ſo done they find their hearts more and more enclined and knit one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (though ſtill with a free and holy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Will of God) and they find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence working for them without, by remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtructions, and making the way plain for them: I think they may comfortably conclude that God hath ſent and called them to joyn themſelves together, and become a holy Temple in the Lord. For when all theſe things do concurr and fall in (as it were) together; undoubtedly it is of God, and by his ſpecial ordering and direction. It was God, that ſet up thoſe holy ends and deſigns in their hearts. It was God that ſtirred up and moved their hearts ſo to pray and wait, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.27. or they could never have ſo done it. It was God, that enabled them to lie down and ſubmit their wills and judgments, to his. It was God that enclined their hearts to one
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53333:68"/>another, and that knit them together in Love, ſo as to chuſe and accept of each other in that holy Relation: and it was God that made their way plain before them. And now what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, why they ſhould not freely unite and joyn together in the Lord, and walk together as heirs of the Kingdome?</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, All things and matters, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Union and Communion together, and becoming a houſe or Church of God; and walking together as <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Members,</hi> in that State and Relation, being thus prepared and made ready for it: They ſhould now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and mutually agree to ſet apart a day to perfect and compleat what is ſo well begun. And firſt they ſhould call in the help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſome other Church or Churches, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the <hi>Elders</hi> of them (if they can), that they may ſee, and be ſatisfied of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and give them the <hi>right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, Gal.</hi> 2.9. and aſſiſt them in the <hi>ſolemn ſetting apart of their Elders,</hi> and help them with their Prayers. 2. They ſhould ſeek the Lord by faſting and prayer, and entreat him in an extraordinary manner, to be with them; guide and direct them; bleſs and proſper them, in their proceedures: and in an eſpecial manner for the Elder, or Elders they are about to chuſe, and (in the Lord) to ſet over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to feed them, and take the overſight of them: That God would give them a double portion of his Spirit, and furniſh them more abundantly with his gifts, and ſpecial grace, and make them able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament. That God would knit their hearts
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53333:69"/>ſo faſt together in the bond of love, as that they may for ever live together in hearty love and peace; and that they may freely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and chearfully perform their reſpective duties to one another, according to the will of Chriſt. And this being done, they ſhould now proceed to chuſe and ſet apart their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>I</hi> mean the Church ſhould appoint one of their Brethren, to expreſs and declare that they have, and now in a more ſolemn manner, do elect and chuſe out ſuch a perſon or perſons from among themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. to be their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to rule, ſeed, watch over, and Miniſter to them in the name of the Lord, as perſons fitted and ſent to them by Jeſus Chriſt, for that end and purpoſe, (as they humbly judge); and further they may declare, that they do thankfully and cordially receive and accept them for their Elders, as the gift of Chriſt unto them, for thoſe ends and ſervices. And when the ſaid Elders are thus choſen and ſet apart, (as alſo ordained) then they may declare their hearty acceptance of the choice, and of the Church as their charge. And for their mutual ſatisfaction, and ſtrengthning their hope and expectation of, and confidence in each other, as alſo for the faſter knitting the Church and Elders together, <hi>I</hi> think it convenient (if not neceſſary) that they do mutually promiſe and covenant to one another, before God and men, that they will really and unfeignedly perform their reſpective works and duties one to another: Namely, ſuch as Jeſus Chriſt requires of them, according as he requires. And when theſe things are done, it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53333:69"/>may be convenient that the Officers or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of other Churches, that are preſent, do declare that they approve of what is done by them, and own them as a Church of Chriſt, and their Elders, now ſet over them, as the Elders and Officers of Chriſt. Now, that the Church Congregated by the will of God, have power to chuſe and approve of all the Officers that Jeſus Chriſt hath given them, hath been ſhewed before, and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it here, but proceed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the work of Paſtors, Teachers or Elders, in a Church of Christ; or for what ends and purpoſes hath Chriſt ſet them there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Their work is, and they are ſet in the Church by Jeſus Chriſt to Preach his word, and to open and make known his mind and will unto them; and as they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and ability, to <hi>reveal the whole Counſel of God, Acts.</hi> 20.27, 28. They are to Preach the word of God; not their own or others fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and conceits, and that diligently, ſincerely, frequently and faithfully, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23. <hi>Acts.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.45. This they muſt do <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. They are to feed <hi>Babes,</hi> with <hi>Milk;</hi> and men, or grown Chriſtians, <hi>with ſtrong Meat, Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. That is, to Adminiſter and apply ſuitable and proper Truths to them, according to their capacities and conditions. They muſt earneſtly beſeech and entreat, as they ſee occaſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1: <hi>Reprove and rebuke Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, with all Authority,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> They are to <hi>comfort the feeble-minded, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53333:70"/>ſupport the weak,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. They muſt ſtudy the Word, and their Churches Souls, caſes and conditions, that they may rightly divide and preſent unto them ſeaſonable food and phyſick, cordials and corriſives; for they will need all, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. and thereby <hi>make full proof of their Miniſtry,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. This they muſt do publickly, and privately, as they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and ability, and that with all poſſible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, wiſdom and meekneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As they muſt ſo attend to their Preaching work in the Church, <hi>ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to their ruling work.</hi> They have the Office, power of Preaching, and ruling from Chriſt, (not from the Church, or any other perſons whatſoever; for they only elect, call, and ſet them apart to the exerciſe of that Power and Authority that Jeſus Chriſt hath given them) all which they are to exerciſe and make uſe of in the Church, for their ſpiritual benefit, and the glory of Chriſt. That they have the power of rule, as well as of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the word and Doctrine, is clear, 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour: eſpecially, they,</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as have the ruling power alſo) <hi>who labour in the word and Doctrine.</hi> Which ſaid ruling power conſiſts, in requiring attention; in charging, commanding, appointing, rebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reproving: in calling together the Church, and diſmiſſing them: in requiring ſpeech and ſilence, in ordering and diſpoſing of matters in the Church; in an authoritative way, examining matters, and calling perſons to an account, and in admitting Members, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53333:70"/>executing the Laws of Chriſt on offenders in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.45. To this part of their work, office, and power they muſt attend; in the wiſe, ſeaſonable exerciſe of it, as occaſion is, or may be offered: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this authority of ruling (from Chriſt), they will be but lame Miniſters, and never able to carry on their Miniſtry, to the glory of Chriſt, and the profit of the Church. And if they have not power to, and do not exerciſe the Authority, and execute the Laws of Chriſt; to ſee too, and require orderly walking of all the Members, and Authoritatively to deal with Offenders and Tranſgreſſors of his Laws; who hath power, or can do it? A Church of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, (as hath been ſhewed) is a Family, a Corporation, and houſhold of God; and it is known to all men, that all Families, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated bodies of men, do, or ought to live under, and ſubmit unto the Laws, Orders, and Diſcipline of thoſe Families, and Corporations whereunto they belong: and in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they have ſuch among them, as have power and Authority to exerciſe Diſcipline, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Laws; to Command, Order and Appoint, what, where, when, and how matters and things ſhall be done amongſt them, for the good of the whole. I think that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a Family, or Church of God, ought moſt carefully to be attended too, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and who ſhall exerciſe it, but his Miniſters and Overſeers? <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. It is true, that Chriſt hath ſet in his Church alſo, another ſort of Rulers, which I think are ſaid to be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53333:71"/>
                  <hi>helps,</hi> to which <hi>Governments</hi> is joyned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) That is, (as I judge), God hath chiefly entruſted the ruling power in the Church, in the hands of his Teaching Elders, and impowered others, to help and aſſiſt them; namely, ſuch as are called <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. For they have need enough of ſuch helps, in their well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Church of Chriſt. (Of which more afterward): This is another part or parcel of Teaching-Elders work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their work is to <hi>Watch; I ſay to watch over the Church.</hi> They are the Churches <hi>Watchmen, to take the overſight of them,</hi> and to make inſpection into them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28, 31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5.2. They are to watch the Wolves and Devil, that would come amongſt them to ſow falſe Doctrines, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, to the breaking of their Peace, and ſpoiling their Communion, and that would corrupt their faith and leaven their judgments: and drive them away from the Sheep-fold, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.29, 30, 31. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, 13. They muſt alſo watch their walkings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and ſee if they are ſuch, <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.27. or whether they be reprovable and ſcandalous: ſo alſo, if they keep to, and practiſe their ſeveral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, and one another, or neglect them; that they may from Chriſt encourage the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and rebuke the negligent, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. They muſt alſo watch and make inſpection into the ſtate and condition of their Souls, and ſee how matters go, or ſtand with them, that they may know how to adminiſter Remedies to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53333:71"/>them, as their caſes do require. They ſhould enquire into their growth or decayes in grace, whether the word &amp; Ordinances of Chriſt do profit or diſprofit them; &amp; as much as poſſible, they ſhould know what uſe and improvement they make of their Goſpel-mercies: as alſo their Tryals and Temptations, their faith and judgments, whether they continue found and ſincere. The Elders of a Church of Chriſt muſt not only carry about the names of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but they muſt do, and attend with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the real and full work of watchmen: they are ſet by him upon his walls, to watch and inſpect his Church: which indeed, is no eaſie work, but full of care, trouble, pains and difficulty. And therefore 'tis no wonder the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> for they are to take care of all the ſpiritual and ſoul-concernments, of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They are to <hi>endeavour the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Truths and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt amongſt them,</hi> and to maintain them, in their power and purity in the Church. When they know any truth, or matter of faith, or practice, doubted of, or called into queſtion by any in the Church; they muſt with all poſſible care, wiſdom, faithfulneſs and diligence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the removal of the doubts and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, maintain the Truths, and eſtabliſh all the Members of the Church in them: for ſhould the errours at any time ſowen among them, be let alone, and ſuffered to take Root in their heads, they will eat into the heart like a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> or (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>Cancer,</hi> or <hi>Gangrene.</hi> To prevent which, the Apoſtle charges <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53333:72"/>and <hi>Titus,</hi> and all Elders of Churches (in them) <hi>to hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. <hi>And to hold faſt the faithful word,</hi> Tit. 1.9. <hi>That by ſound Doctrine they may convince Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</hi> And this was alwayes <hi>Paul</hi>'s care and practice; (as was ſhewed) either to prevent the corrupting of Truth, and mens Souls with errours, or to overthrow and root them up, where they were entertained: Thus the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt ought to do now, and that for Chriſt, his Truths, and Churches ſakes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>They muſt adminiſter all Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, with all poſſible diligence, care, zeal and faithfulneſs.</hi> It is their work and place to do it, and therefore they muſt not be careleſs or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent; but watch, ſeek for and obſerve all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for the doing of it: that the Church ſuffer no detriment by their neglects, which they will quickly do, if neglected, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews. They muſt not only care to Preach well, but to adminiſter all other <hi>Appointments</hi> of Chriſt alſo, in their ſeaſons; for all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Jeſus Chriſt, are the Churches food and proviſions, and the means and way appointed by him, for the Communicating and diſpenſing of his Grace, Spirit, yea and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto their Souls: and indeed without the Ordinances of the houſe, the houſe or Church cannot ſubſiſt; and they are the authorized Stewards of the houſe, to give the Lords Houſhold, all their proviſions in due ſeaſon, that they may be fat and flouriſhing under his keeping and Donations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92, 12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Every Church Ordinance is a Golden Pipe to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53333:72"/>convey light, life and holineſs into Believers hearts, and as Breaſts to convey nouriſhment to the Soul. They are ſpiritual Ladders to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the hearts and graces of Believers up to Heaven, and lodge their minds and affections there; and they are as the <hi>Ark, where God will come and meet his people,</hi> Eſa. 64.5. Therefore they muſt be carefully, frequently, and holily diſpenſed and adminiſtred by them, who are ſet there to do it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>They muſt ſtand between God and the Church, with holy hearts, hands and tongues lifted up to Heaven for the Church, or in their behalf, and that privately and publickly.</hi> For their work and office, is not only to Miniſter to them from Chriſt; but they are to preſent their wants, deſires, and gratitude to God for them alſo: which is no eaſie work to do. They muſt pray and wreſtle with God for them, as for their own Souls, and carry them upon their hearts and ſouls in their ſecret addreſſes to God, and plead with God importunately for them, as they do for their own Souls: and that not as Believers only, but as their Teachers and ſpiritual Fathers alſo. Certainly, this is one great part of their work and buſineſs, and therefore they may not neglect it, but are bound to be diligent in it, in ſecret: and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, when preſent with them, they muſt bleſs them, and the word and ſeals, miniſterially, and that by virtue of their place, office, and power in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24, 25, 26. Thus bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> was much in the practice of, namely, in preſenting the Churches caſes to God, and wreſtling with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53333:73"/>God for them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Wherefore we pray alwayes for you.</hi> So <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Reſolve doubts and caſes, that trouble any of the Members of the Church, when they are preſented to them, if they are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters worthy conſideration.</hi> They muſt ſtudy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſcience, and ſuch doubts and ſcruples as may ariſe in the hearts or heads of their people, that they may be ready to apply ſome ſatisfying Medicine unto them. They are to ſtudy perſons, and their caſes, and maladies, as well as the Scriptures: for they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be able to apply, and rightly to uſe a word in ſeaſon to weary, troubled, &amp; burthened Souls, as well as to Preach publickly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly to all, from a ſtudied, compoſed ſubject. This work of Teachers in the Church, is no light ordinary matter: it will ſhew what they are, and try their learning and abilities for their work, more than any thing elſe. It is a ſpecial gift of God, and an evidence of an able ſpiritual Phyſician indeed, who can find out ſpiritual Diſeaſes of mens Souls, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily apply proper Remedies to them, that can rightly <hi>ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Eſa. 50.4. <hi>and comfort the feeble-minded,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. The Lord Jeſus, and <hi>Paul,</hi> were much exerciſed and imployed in this work, and ſo ſhould Teachers now, as occaſion is offered. <hi>For the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and the people ſhould ſeek the Law at their mouths,</hi> Mal. 2.7. They are given to the Churches, to be their ſpiritual <hi>Nurſes</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> for the cure and health of their Souls; and therefore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53333:73"/>they muſt adminiſter Phyſick and Cordials un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſick and pained Souls, in private, as well as in publick.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, That they may diſcharge their Miniſterial work, as becomes the Miniſters of Chriſt; <hi>They muſt exerciſe themſelves in reading and ſtudying.</hi> They muſt give themſelves to reading, and ſtudying the Scriptures, the works and providences of God; as alſo their own experiences: and they muſt read, ſearch, and endeavour all they can to know the ſtates, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, conditions, and wants of their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flocks: that they may <hi>make full proof of their Miniſtry,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.5. <hi>Divide the word of Truth aright,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. Speak words in ſeaſon to all ſorts, (eſpecially) to weary and burthened Souls, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50.4. And that they may both <hi>ſave themſelves, and thoſe that hear them,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt be continually lying in, as well as lying out: they muſt furniſh themſelves with Grace, Truth, and Experiences, that they may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto others out of the <hi>good Treaſure of their hearts.</hi> Their hearts, heads and lips muſt be filled with varieties of Divine and Heavenly matters, that they may freely and readily impart of their receivings to every ones needs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Their Lord and Maſter charges them to <hi>give attendance to reading,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13. To <hi>Meditation,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.15. And to <hi>ſtudy,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. They muſt <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5.39. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. <hi>And inſpect their people,</hi> Pro. 27.23. 2 Tim. 4.5. Acts 20.28. They muſt not look for immediate Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53333:74"/>nor to be furniſhed with all needful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes from Heaven, for the diſcharge of their office and Miniſterial work in the Churches of Chriſt, by the ſpirit; but in and by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of Gods means. God that appoints and promiſes the end, appoints and directs us to, and in the uſe of the means, leading to the obtainment of that end. The end directed to, in and by the ſaid means, is the ſupply of Grace, Gifts, and all neceſſary and profitable miniſterial abilities, for ſuch as Chriſt puts into the work, and office, of teaching and ruling in his Churches. Therefore they may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to, or take up with any other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that may any way impede or hinder them in, or of the aforeſaid duties; But in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>But did not</hi> Paul <hi>work with his hands, and labour in other buſineſſes, and exerciſe himſelf in worldly and ſecular matters, after he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the work of the Miniſtry? And if ſo; why may not other men do the ſame as well as he?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſaw before, what ordinary Elders ought to do, and are bound to attend unto in their places and offices, namely, to <hi>give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to the work of the Miniſtry, which they had received in the Lord,</hi> Col. 4.17. <hi>That they fulfill it:</hi> that they attend to Study, Reading, Meditation, Exhortation, Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>And that they wait on the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examples muſt not be taken and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt precepts. <hi>Paul</hi> was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officer or Miniſter; his work and power
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53333:74"/>was every where, where the Lord called him to Preach: he was not a particular fixed Elder, or Paſtour to one ſingle Church, neither was he bound or neceſſitated to attend to reading, ſtudying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ordinary Miniſters are. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles, had their office, power, their abilities and furnitures for their work, immediately from Chriſt in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way and manner, which ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (now) have not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured not with his hands, or neglected his Miniſterial work, but when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated thereunto: and the Apoſtles at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> Act. 6. tells us, <hi>That it was unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that they ſhould leave the word of God and ſerve Tables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Ordinary Paſtours or Elders of Churches, do find that their ſo attending to their work (in their Studies) as commanded, abſolutely neceſſary, for the diſcharge and well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the work their Lord hath given them to do; and experience ſhews beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that the moſt ſtudious holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are the moſt powerful and profitable in their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The great and rich proviſions that God hath made for them, in their faithful attendance to their work in the Churches, fully proves and declares what they ſhould do and attend unto. God hath commanded their Hearers to provide carnal things for them; yea to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to them in all good things, that they may attend on their work, and wait at the Altar without diſtraction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53333:75"/>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>They muſt be eminently holy and righteous in all manner of Converſation.</hi> They are <hi>Lights,</hi> and therefore they muſt ſhine as ſuch in the World. They are the <hi>Salt</hi> of the Earth, and therefore they muſt be of ſavory Spirits and practices, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15, 16. Miniſters of the Goſpel are given for, and commanded to be <hi>examples to their Flocks,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.12. 1 Pet. 5.3. They are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly bound to imitate their Maſter, and to teach, lead and conduct them in holineſs to Heaven, as well by their walkings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, as by their Miniſtry: that they may ſafely and comfortably follow them. <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. 1 Cor. 4.16. 2 Theſ. 3.7.</p>
               <p>Surely, ſuch as Chriſt hath ſet in his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to feed, nouriſh, comfort, ſtrengthen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and build up his people; to conduct, lead and guide them in the way of Goſpel-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to everlaſting happineſs; ſhould be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in practical Godlineſs themſelves.

(2) They muſt be diligent and conſtant in their Work.

               <p>Q. <hi>HOw ought Church-Members to behave themſelves towards their Paſtours, or teaching Elders? or what are their works and duties towards them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the will and appointment of the Lord Jeſus, the King &amp; head of his Churches, that they ſhould carry and behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards them in heart and practiſe, as to <hi>his Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> who come to them in his name, by his <hi>Miſſion, Authority,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> with his Gifts and Grace; upon his Errand and Buſineſs, as alſo for their Souls profit. They bear his <hi>Image,</hi> wear his <hi>Livery,</hi> do his work, and ſerve his Intereſts in the Churches. And therefore he that <hi>ſlighteth or deſpiſeth</hi> them, ſlights and deſpiſeth him and his Father too; <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. and he or they, that receive them that love, honour &amp; carry it well to them, becauſe they are his, ſent of him, Commiſſioned and qualified by him to ſerve and honour him in the Churches; they do thereby receive, honour and love Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. They receive, honour and love Jeſus Chriſt, in and by receiving, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and loving them as ſuch; and whatever good they do them, or whatever reſpect they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53333:77"/>ſhew them (as ſuch), the <hi>Lord Jeſus takes it as done to himſelf,</hi> Matth. 10. <hi>ult.</hi> Matth. 25. Therefore all Church-members ought to carry and behave themſelves well towards them, and amongſt other things in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They ought to love them;</hi> I ſay to love them, and that with all cordial tender affection. They muſt not love them as they do other Saints of God, only; but they muſt have ſingular love for, and ſhew ſpecial love unto them, as Chriſts Embaſſadors, and their Miniſters, 1 Theſ. 5.12, 13. <hi>And we beſeech you Brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you: And to eſteem very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> They muſt be loved on ſeveral accounts. 1. As good men, and living Members of Chriſt; and ſo we are to love them as fellow-Brethren, as we do other private Members. 2. It is the will and appointment of Chriſt, that they be loved as his Embaſſadors and Commiſſioners, as his Stewards and Officers, gifted and ſent forth by him, about his concerns in his Churches, to do his work and buſineſs; and as repreſenting him, by officiating in his Name, by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and doing his Meſſage. 3. They ought to be loved as your Miniſters, Guides, Feeders, and Overſeers: as ſent unto you from Chriſt, and diſpenſing the bread of life, and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdom of Heaven to you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Counſel of God, and adminiſtring his holy appointments to you for your preſent comfort, eſtabliſhment and growth in grace, and for your eternal happineſs hereafter, <hi>eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:53333:77"/>Theſe are ſome of the Reaſons, why they ſhould be loved more than any other Believers; namely, becauſe they are ſent, Authorized, Graced, Gifted and qualified by Chriſt, do his work, repreſent him, ſtand in his ſtead, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.) and as they are his Miniſters for good to you. Well then, mind your duty, and the will of Chriſt in this matter, and love them ſincerely and heartily; ſtrongly and fervently, fruitfully and conſtantly; for they love you, ſtudy, pray and labour to do you good. And know that if you do not love them, you do not love Chriſt, whoſe they are, whom they repreſent and ſerve. And if you hate, ſlight and deſpiſe them, you do hate, ſlight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Chriſt himſelf in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is the will and appointment of Chriſt, your duty to honour and reſpect, to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and eſteem them, in their faithful diligent diſcharge of their Truſt, and performance of their work amongſt you.</hi> They are the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and Commiſſioners of your great Lord and King, and ſent by him from Heaven to you, (as was ſhewed) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and that about moſt high and honourable work, yea the higheſt work and ſervice that Creatures are capable of in this World. They come from, and are ſent to you by the King of Kings, from Heaven, and therefore they muſt be honoured. They are his Embaſſadors and Commiſſioners, and therefore you muſt honour them. They are ſent and come to you, as with his Image of Authority, ſo of Grace, Gifts, and Holineſs; and therefore you muſt honour them. They are ſent by Chriſt to you, on, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53333:78"/>for the ſervice of your Souls; and therefore you muſt honour them: and they repreſent Chriſt, and ſtand in his ſtead to you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt honour them. They do give up themſelves to be your ſervants, and thereby do honour you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. and they chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerve the intereſt of your Souls, as your ſpiritual ſervants; and therefore you muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them. Chriſt requires you to eſteem them, and that is not all; <hi>but to eſteem them highly,</hi> yea <hi>very highly too;</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.13. and therefore you muſt do it; Chriſt will not ſuffer you to ſlight or deſpiſe them, no more than Kings will endure that any ſhould ſlight or deſpiſe their Embaſſadors. If you have low, baſe thoughts of them in your hearts, you ſlight and deſpiſe them. If you ſlight and deſpiſe their labours and adminiſtrations, you deſpiſe them. If you villifie and ſpeak ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of them behind their backs, and devulge their ſuppoſed or real weakneſſes, you deſpiſe them. If you carry your ſelves ſaucily, and imperiouſly before their face, in words, deeds, or deportments, you ſlight and deſpiſe them; and if you controul them, and diſregard their Judgments, Cenſures, Admonitions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, you ſlight and deſpiſe them; when you turn a deaf ear to their Counſels, Inſtructions and Exhortations you ſlight and deſpiſe them; and when you diſregard their power, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their exerciſe thereof in the name of Chriſt, you ſlight and deſpiſe them. In theſe and many other wayes and inſtances, Church-Members do not only neglect their indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty of honouring their Teaching-Elders,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53333:78"/>but they do ſlight and deſpiſe them alſo. And they do not only ſlight and deſpiſe them, but (as was ſaid) the Lord Jeſus, his Laws, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, work and Authority alſo. <hi>For he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) Luk. 10.16. And by theſe and ſuch like ſlighting, and contemptible words, and carriages towards them, they do greatly provoke and diſcourage them: they weaken their hands, and diſtract their minds, and ſo hinder them in their work. They are honoured by Chriſt, and honourable in his eye; and he ſtrictly charges and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Churches to eſteem them moſt, or very highly, and to give them double honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour: eſpecially, they who labour in the word and Doctrine. Give</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>to every man his due, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour,</hi> Rom. 13.7. It is their due by the Law of Chriſt, and he expects you ſhould give it to them: not as they are ſuch or ſuch men, but as his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is the will and appointment of Chriſt, that Churches ſhould pray for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, or Teaching Elders, and that in a more than ordinary manner and meaſure;</hi> I mean, more than they do, or are bound to do for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. you muſt be earneſt, and importunate <hi>wreſtlers</hi> with God (at the Throne of Grace) for them, that God would pour out abundance of his holy ſpirit on them, and by his teachings, quicknings and anointings, make them <hi>able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53333:79"/>Letter</hi> (only) <hi>but of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. That they may <hi>open their mouths boldly,</hi> have the gift of <hi>utterance,</hi> and ſpeak the Truth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, clearly, impartially, and conſtantly <hi>make known the myſtery of the Goſpel,</hi> Eph. 6.18, 19. Col. 4.3. That they may be kept from Snares and Temptations, or be enabled to encounter them, and with the Sword of the ſpirit to overcome and conquer them: and that they may be eminent ſhining lights in the world. That they may be able to <hi>divide the word aright,</hi> diligent in, and faithful to their Truſt. That they may be wiſe, zealous and glorious <hi>Patterns</hi> of Piety &amp; all Godlineſs, and be kept <hi>unſpotted of the world;</hi> and that they may abound in all grace, gifts, works of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs. That they may Preach powerfully and profitably, and in all their wayes, words and carriages <hi>adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 2.10. That they may be found in the faith of the Goſpel, and hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the faith without wavering; <hi>Preach ſound Doctrine,</hi> clearly, plainly, and cloſely, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.1. and in all things approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the true Miniſters of Chriſt. That God would give them the ſpirit of Diſcipline and Government, for the order and well being of the Churches, and the orderly management of their concerns, and that they may in all things walk by their Lords Rules, and aim at, deſign and uprightly intend his glory, and the profit of his people, and all others that hear them. There are many reaſons inforcing this duty on them to your Paſtours: Ile name a few, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God that you ſhould do
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53333:79"/>ſo, as the aforeſaid Scriptures ſhew. 2. Becauſe they ſtand in need of your earneſt prayers. If the Apoſtles themſelves did ſtand in need of the Churches prayers, much more muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teachers need them. Their work is hard and difficult, <hi>who is ſufficient for it,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. Their diſcouragements are many and great, and their Temptations many, ſtrong and powerful. They have myſteries to unfold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and they have ſtronger Temptations to grapple with all, than others have; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould have your ſtrongeſt and moſt importunate prayers. Little do Churches know what they ſee, feel, and experience in their work, and therefore are apt to imagine, that their Teachers have an eaſie and ſweet life of it, and ſtand in little need of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. But ſurely they are miſtaken; for there is no work in the world, ſo full of care and trouble as a conſciencious Miniſter is, nor any that requires more diligence, circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, watchfulneſs and faithfulneſs than his. They work and labour in Divine Myſteries; and they work for Chriſt and Souls. Their matters lye above the reach of carnal and meer rational underſtandings; above the reaches of humane Arts and Sciences, and they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſulting and converſant about new matters and things. Oh, what need have they of the Churches prayers! 3. Becauſe the Churches profit and Souls benefit, is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in their Teachers Adminiſtrations. For God ordinarily ſpeaks to the Churches hearts, through or by their hearts, as well as by their mouths. The more they have of Chriſt,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53333:80"/>Grace, Truth, and the Spirit of Chriſt, the more powerful, ſpiritual and profitable they will be in prayer, Preaching, and in all other Miniſtrations unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is the will of Chriſt, and their indiſpenſible duty to know, obey, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Teaching Elders or Paſtours Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Teaching, Government, and to all their regular and orderly. Miniſtrations in the Lord.</hi> The Church owes them <hi>ſubjection and obedience;</hi> and that as they are ſet over them by Chriſt, and by him made their Teachers and Rulers, and ſent by him to take the charge and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them, and to Adminiſter his holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to them in his name, for their good, Heb. 13.7, 17. <hi>Remember them that have the Rule over you</hi> (or are Guides unto you, as the words alſo ſignifie). <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> Without Government and Governours; power and Authority; Laws and Orders, and without ſubjection and obedience, in and of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all ſorts of Corporations and Societies of men in the world, whether civil or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, they will be, but confuſed <hi>Routs</hi> and <hi>Babels:</hi> There will be, can be nothing but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and every evil work,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. If they are Rulers, and have Authority from the Lord Jeſus to appoint, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and command, as 'tis clear they have, (or they are but ſhadows or cyphers,) 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.4, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> then they may,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53333:80"/>yea they ought to appoint, order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as they ſee occaſion, for the profit and well being of the Church, in purſuance of their work and truſt. And if ſo, then the Church and all the Members thereof, are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly bound to yield all free, hearty, willing, and chearful ſubjection and obedience to them, without grudging, quarrelling, or irregular gain-ſaying, that is, they are to eye the will and authority of Chriſt in, and expreſſed by them: and ſo to conform to it, as it is Chriſts, not theirs. They muſt obey them not as gifted men, but as the <hi>Embaſſadours, Miniſters and Officers</hi> of Chriſt, and it is Chriſt, and his will and Authority in them, that muſt be the object of their obedience and ſubjection. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whereof is, when through careleſneſs or wilfulneſs, no leſs than diſobedience too, yea Rebellion againſt the Lord Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. Great was the love and care of Chriſt, as the head and King of his Churches, in providing Lawes, Rules, and Orders, as alſo in Authorizing and ſending ſome to execute them, for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, and his glory. And therefore when Church-Members do ſlight, neglect, diſobey, and practically deſpiſe them; they do thereby ſlight, contemn and deſpiſe the love, care and Authority of Chriſt; and Chriſt accounts it ſo, although thoſe teaching Rulers are not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but ordinary Officers, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16, 17. ſhews when the Lord Jeſus went to Heaven, <hi>he gave gifts to men,</hi> (viz.) Miniſters, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial abilities to them, <hi>for the work of the Miniſtry, for the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53333:81"/>Eph. 4.10, 11, 12. Then he delegated his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial power to men, promiſed to provide ſuch for his Saints, and to furniſh them with his own gifts, yea <hi>to be with them himſelf, unto the end of the world,</hi> Math. 28.18, 19, 20. Wherefore then, the Churches of Chriſt ſhould receive, ſubmit to and obey them (in a ſenſe) even as Chriſt himſelf, as they are Authorized, gifted, granted and ſent by him, in and about his meſſage, work and ſervice, in all their lawful commands and appointments, and regular Miniſtrations in and for the Churches. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) of the 70. <hi>Diſciples</hi> he ſent to Preach, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.40. And <hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for <hi>receiving him, as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt himſelf,</hi> Gal. 4.14, 15. and the ſame Apoſtle charges <hi>Titus,</hi> to ſpeak and act in the Church <hi>with all Authority,</hi> charging all the Members alſo, <hi>not to deſpiſe or ſlight him,</hi> for, or in his ſo doing, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15. If not to deſpiſe or ſlight him, then to honour, ſubmit to, and obey him, as Chriſts and their Miniſter. Well then! do the Elders or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of Churches carefully mind, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently labour in the Word and Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>then all the Members of Churches are bound to obey them:</hi> to ſubmit to, and wait on their Miniſtry; and not deſpiſe them and it, by deſerting and withdrawing from it, in whole, or in part. (But more of this anon). 2. Do they appoint meetings, or call their Churches to aſſemble together for the celebration of any Ordinance of God, or to conſult about the matters and concernments of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53333:81"/>the Church for their profit and Chriſts glory? they are bound in duty to do ſo (excepting in extraordinary caſes that hinder them) as they will anſwer the contrary contempt to Chriſt, at their peril. They muſt not look on their practical conformity to it, as an indifferent matter, and ſtay at home, or come at their own will and pleaſure, but actually obey ſuch a call or ſummons as Chriſt's: not diſpute it, but obey it: not in the pride of their hearts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it, but readily and chearfully ſubject to it. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, for they watch for your Souls;</hi> Heb. 13.17. and be ſure when they appoint ſuch meetings, it is for the Churches advantage. 3. Do they appoint or require ſpeech or ſilence in the Church, or any good Orders and Rules to be obſerved and kept in the name of Chriſt, and by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? they are bound to obey them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loading them, and obſtructing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with Jangling diſputes and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as in theſe, ſo in all other matters, wherein the honour of Chriſt, the profit of the Church, or any Members thereof conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Rulers muſt ſee that they command and appoint, order and rule wiſely, and faithfully, and keep cloſe to their Commiſſion; deſign and carry on Chriſt's holy ends in all: and as they muſt rule well, ſo all the Members ruled by them muſt obey well too. And when both do their duties in their places, the Lord Chriſt is honoured and pleaſed, and all the Church are, or may be profited and edified, and peace and truth promoted. But on the contrary, all confuſion, diſorder, and diſturbances will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53333:82"/>follow, as ſad experience hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved in this Land.</p>
               <p>It is a clear and certain truth, (obvious to all men) that if ſome muſt rule, others muſt obey? And if ſome are appointed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Great and abſolute Soveraign to Rule and Govern well; then it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, be the indiſpenſible duty of others to ſubmit and obey well. All according and in obedience to the Authority and Soveraign will of their Great Law giver, the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves,</hi> is as indiſpenſible a duty, as any you have to do; which I could abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, by many Scripture Reaſons, had I room in this Diſcourſe to enlarge on it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is the will of Chriſt, and the Churches indiſpenſible duty, to ſimpathize with their Teachers, to help and encourage them, to ſtrengthen their hands, and comfort their hearts; and to do all they can to forward them in their work: that they may fulfil their Miniſtry, and do their whole duty with joy, and not with grief,</hi>

                  </gap>ol. 4.17. Heb. 13.17. For whatever you do, for or againſt them, you do it for or againſt Chriſt himſelf, whoſe Embaſſadours and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers they are to you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. They have his Image of Authority ſtampt on them, and are ſent to you by himſelf about, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his work amongſt you.

And therefore when
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53333:82"/>you burden and diſcourage them, you hinder your ſelves of profit, and when you comfort, help and encourage them in their Miniſterial work, you further your own happineſs thereby. This is clearly intimated by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. (before mentioned) <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you: for they watch for your Souls; that they may do it with joy, and not with grief:</hi> Now mark his Reaſon, why! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>that will be unprofitable for you.</hi> The meaning is, the better you carry it towards your Teachers, who watch for your Souls, and the more profitable you are to them, the more profitable they will be to you: the more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and comfortable you are to them, the more uſeful and comfortable they will be to you. We ſay, it is encouragement that makes a good <hi>Oratour,</hi> and much more doth encouragement from Chriſtians, make (in a ſenſe) good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. There is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween working under diſcouragement and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, diſcouragements from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do as it were unhinge Miniſters, and cauſe them to Travel in pain, like Porters, with preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing heavy burdens on their backs. Their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes do greatly cumber and diſtract them, trouble and perplex them, diſcompoſe and deject them: they exceedingly weaken their hands, and ſadden their hearts, and even make their lives a burden to them. And that becauſe the true Miniſters of Chriſt do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and heartily love their people, as that, had they encouragement from them, they <hi>could freely ſpend, and be ſpent for them,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.15. and they do expect a great deal of hearty
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53333:83"/>love and kindneſs from them again, as well they may; for that Chriſt requires it of them towards their Miniſters, and they ſpend their time and ſtrength in their ſervice and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yea, and when they called them to take the overſight of them, they engaged ſo to do. But now being diſappointed of their ſo reaſonable expectation, they cannot but lay it to heart, and cry out of wrong, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> did. To prevent which, the Lord Jeſus charges and ſtrictly enjoyns all his people, to ſee they carry themſelves well towards his and their Miniſters. 1. By avoiding whatever may grieve or trouble them. 2. By giving them all poſſible encouragements. 1. Would you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and ſtrengthen your Teachers in their work, then attend on their Miniſtry and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, ſeriouſly, dutifully, conſcienciouſly and conſtantly. The neglect of your ſo doing, doth greatly diſcourage them, ſadden their hearts, and weaken their hands. The liberty ſome take (which Chriſt never gave them) to withdraw as they pleaſe, from their Miniſters, and rambling up and down here and there, as they pleaſe; either from their prejudice, pride, ignorance or giddineſs of ſpirit: or from a wanton, laviſh, vain ſpirit; from their <hi>itching cars</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. or from the Devil; is exceedingly hurtful to them, as well as to the Souls of ſuch Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors. So likewiſe when they come to their Adminiſtrations unſeaſonably, or untimely, and do there carry and demean themſelves careleſly, indifferently and unreverently; they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53333:83"/>caſt a ſtumbling block before them, and cauſe great offence to them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, you muſt attend on their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, as on Chriſts and your own Miniſtry, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, timely, conſcientiouſly, diligently, freely, dutifully and conſtantly when they Preach and Adminiſter: for that is your duty, and the contrary is your ſin; which in time <hi>will find you out.</hi> For you by your ſo doing, walk diſorderly, ſcandalouſly, irregularly, and contrary to the charge given you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.25. <hi>not forſaking the Aſſembling of your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is.</hi> You walk out of your folds, and prodigally run out of the place where the providence of God hath ſet you, and commanded you to abide and worſhip him in, until he do by ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſation call you off, you expoſe your ſelves to great danger, and tempt the holy Spirit to withdraw his Divine influences from you: and I dare peremptorily affirm, that while any do ſo, they are back-ſliding from God, and God is going off from them; that they ſhall never thrive nor proſper in Grace, nor have any Ordinances bleſſed to them; and though their wanton diſorderly wayes ſeem right unto them, <hi>yet they lead to death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. Moreover, ſuch neglects in Church-Members tends directly to the breaking of the Churches of Chriſt, and all good Order, Peace and proſperity in them; and to the bringing in of all irregularities and confuſion, to the great ſcandal of the Goſpel; diſhonour of Chriſt, offence of the faithful, and to the breaking of their Miniſters hearts.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53333:84"/>Which certainly will have bitterneſs in the end; although it may be pleaſing to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a while. Oh! how grievous muſt ſuch courſes of Church-Members needs be unto their Paſtours? who have prayed, ſtudied, and laboured to make good proviſion for them, to comfort and build up their ſouls in Chriſt, and that in hopes of finding them there in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive it, when they come to hand it out to them; and then ſhall either find them gone, or elſe there in an irreverent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This pierces their hearts, and deeply wounds their poor Souls. But on the contrary, when they ſee their flocks ſeriouſly, reverently, ſeaſonably, and conſtantly keep their places, and worſhip God together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly and dutifully: this lightens, gladens and comforts their hearts; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens their hands, and puts (as it were) a new life into them. It oyles the Wheels; and helps to make them run on eaſily, ſweetly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. If it be the duty of Miniſters to wait on their Office, to Preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; to attend to the Miniſtry of the word, and to feed their flocks and watch over them; as indeed it is. Then undoubtedly, it is the indiſpenſible duty of ſuch to attend and wait on their Miniſtry. For the work is relative. And the ſame Authority that binds the one, binds alſo the other. The one muſt Preach and Adminiſter, and the other muſt freely, dutifully, and conſtantly wait on their Adminiſtrations. And let me tell you and aſſure you, that by your deſerting your Miniſters in whole or in part, you deſpiſe them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53333:84"/>and their Miniſtry; you expoſe your ſelves to inevitable Reproach (for it is a ſcandalous ſin) and your Miniſters and their Miniſtry to great deriſion and contempt, and this will coſt you dear one day.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we cannot profit by them; their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations are dead to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be ſo, but whoſe fault is that, theirs or yours? will you lay the blame on them, when indeed it is your own? is that juſtice, or horrible injuſtice? Prov. 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the juſt: even they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi> You did once value and eſteem them, and found life and refreſhing in their Miniſtry? elſe why did you joyn with them, call and chuſe them for your Miniſters? They did not force themſelves on you, you were at your free choice, to refuſe them, and ſit down under others Miniſtry. Beſides, while you pretend that the cauſe of your deſerting ſuch as you have choſen and once found good by, others of the ſame Congregation find their Miniſtry very profitable to them ſtill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to wait on it, and bleſs God for it; and abhor all thoughts of deſerting it: If ſo, then it is evident that God is with your Miniſters, and bleſſes their Miniſtry; and then what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? but that the fault is in you, not in your Miniſtry. For why ſhould not you profit by it as well as others? but that the obſtruction is at home? And it would better become you, and argue a better ſpirit in you, to ſearch out the plagues of your own hearts, and lay the blame where it is, than where it is not. If
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53333:85"/>you find no good by their Miniſtry, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you (1) have left God in ſecret? God and you are become ſtrangers at home? If it be ſo, as moſt likely it is, then wonder not if the Ordinances of God profit you not. For what can you expect to find in Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, when God is departed from you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are departed from God? There is a <hi>woe</hi> pronounced to ſuch, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 9.12. (2.) Do you not live in ſome known ſin without Repentance? It is more than probable you do: and if ſo, then be ſure you will find no good in any of Gods Ordinances, untill that Idol be removed by Repentance, out of your hearts and hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.2, 3, 7. <hi>Joſhua.</hi> 7. ſays God to ſuch, <hi>I will anſwer you according to your Idols;</hi> who preſume to come before me with Idols in your hearts, as every known ſin is. (3.) Have you not <hi>conceived a diſpleaſure, and taken up prejudice</hi> againſt your Miniſters perſons, or their Miniſtry. If ſo, no marvel if you profit not by them? But then I ſay, that's your fault, not theirs: you have laid a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block in your own way, and obſtruct your profitting, by the works of your own hands. So ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were prejudiced againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and they could by no means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by his Miniſtry; and therefore away they go to <hi>Apollo.</hi> Why, what's the matter? why! he had not ſuch <hi>excellent ſpeech</hi> and language as <hi>Apolle</hi> had, 1 Cor. 2.1. <hi>and his bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech contemptible,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.10. Alas! <hi>Paul</hi> is an inconſiderable fellow; We did love, affect and wait, on his Miniſtry, and time was, we received profit by it. But
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53333:85"/>now the caſe is altered; <hi>Paul</hi> is no man for us, no, but <hi>Apollo,</hi> a man of more Eloquence ſhall be our man now, a Ruſh for <hi>Paul.</hi> Well, to <hi>Apollo</hi> they go, and leave poor <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach to their ſeats, or ſhift for himſelf. But it is not long that <hi>Apollo</hi> ſhall pleaſe them and be their man, no, but to <hi>Cephas</hi> they go, and where then, God knows. But was this their vertue, and a proof of their ſpiritual growth and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments? no, but on the contrary, the Holy Ghoſt tells them once and again, that they did wickedly by their ſhiftings from one Teacher to another, and proved themſelves but poor, low, carnal profeſſors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. This is ordinarily (if not alwayes) one cauſe of mens leaving their own Miniſters. And you that are guilty of it now, will find this evil humour at the bottom of your ſhifting, and withdrawing from your Teachers; would you ſuffer your Conſciences to ſpeak out, and ſearch them to the bottom; but that you are not willing to ſee your own ſpots in a clear Glaſs. (4.) Do you not profit by the Miniſtry of your own Miniſters? why! is it not your <hi>Pride?</hi> do you not conceit that you are wiſer than they, and ſo they are unmeet and unworthy to teach you, and you are too high and good to learn or be taught of them? half an eye may ſee that this is alſo in the bottom of your deſertions: you are not poor and hungry hearers, nor little in your own eyes, but are too full of conceits of your own abilities, and baſe conceits of your Teachers; and therefore you are not profitted by their Miniſtry. This alſo was the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Diſeaſe,</hi> which made them ſlight <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53333:86"/>Miniſtry as unprofitable and unworthy of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2, 11. (5.) And as in theſe cauſes at home you will, or may find, why you do not profit by the Miniſtry of your own Teachers; ſo likewiſe becauſe the world, and the deceitful pleaſures and profits thereof do lye deep in your hearts, and ſwallow up, yea drown your minds and affections. In a word, you want love to Chriſt, his word, Ordinances and Miniſters, and therefore you do not profit, you do not pray heartily and fervently for them, that God would make them able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the New Teſtament, and bleſs their Miniſtry to your Souls profit: and therefore they profit you not. Again, <hi>you trouble, diſtract and grieve their hearts, contrary to the will of God: and therefore they cannot profit you.</hi> And by theſe and many other ſinful wayes, you <hi>grieve the holy Spirit ſo,</hi> as that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with, nor bleſs and proſper their ſincere endeavours to do you good. But then I ſay ſtill, the fault is in you, not in them; they would, but cannot mend theſe things in you, but ſo may you if you will. And know for certain, that if you are really willing to know theſe and other cauſes in your ſelves; and ſhall deal truly with your own hearts, and conſciences in the caſe, you will find what I have ſaid to be a great truth. And whether or no, you will know and own it, yet be ſure that God (the great heart-ſearcher) doth know it is ſo. And let me adviſe and counſel you, in the fear of God, to haſten to find out theſe plagues of your own hearts, and ways, and get deep convictions of them; humble your ſelves
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53333:86"/>before God unfeignedly for them: confeſs your Errours and ſins, and take the blame and ſhame to your ſelves, <hi>for harbouring ſuch Vipers in your boſoms;</hi> falſly blaming and charging your Teachers, with your own evils, juſtifying the guilty (your ſelves) and condemning the juſt (your Miniſters) which the Lord abhors. Sue out pardons in the blood of Chriſt, and do all you can towards the removal of all the hindrances of your profitting by your own Miniſtry, out of the way, and get a meek, humble, hungering and thirſting Spirit, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual frame of heart, love to Chriſt, his Word and Ordinances, to your own Teachers, and their Adminiſtrations; and ſee if the caſe do not alter. Prove, if their Miniſtry do not profit you, and if God do not indeed bleſs and proſper their labours to you. If you ſhall in good earneſt do theſe things, and come in obedience to hear them, as to an Ordinance of Chriſt for your good; look unto, and depend on him for his preſence and bleſſing on your attendance on their Miniſtry: ſet your ſelves in ſincerity of heart before the face of God to receive his word, and the bleſſed power and efficacy of it on your Souls, and give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attention to what you hear, and reſolve unfeignedly, and endeavour with all your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities (as you are bound to do) to practiſe, and rightly improve all you hear to your own and others profit, and the glory of God in all. I dare boldly aſſure you, that you ſhall find the bleſſing of all Ordinances Adminiſtred by them to your Souls. Therefore try and prove it ſo (as you ought, and may do, and your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53333:87"/>will fully and clearly anſwer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and remove all difficulties out of the way.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we find the Miniſtry of others more profitable to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's ſtrange, and no leſs than a groſſe deluſion; for can you indeed believe on a Scripture foundation and evidence, that God hath commanded you to obey him to your loſs &amp; detriment? God hath charged his Churches, <hi>to aſſemble themſelves together,</hi> namely, with their own Teachers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>and to obey them that have the Rule, or overſight over them;</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>and to know them which labour among them, and are over them in the Lord, and to eſteem very highly in love, for their works ſake,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.12.13. here is your duty. And if ſo, then be ſure God intended all he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, for your profit and advantage, and in no caſe to your diſprofit; he that hath with your own free conſent, ſet you in ſuch a Church, given you ſuch a Miniſtry, enclined your hearts to make choice of it, and them for your Miniſtry and Miniſters, ſealed their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to others, if not to you (for the aboveſaid Reaſons) commanded them to feed you, and watch over you, and given them hearts to do it, from time to time; did undoubtedly know what was beſt for you, and deſign your profit, and the good of the whole. And if he had, had an intention to have made uſe of others, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of thoſe you have to your greater advantage, he would in ſeaſon have directed you to them, or elſe they to you; and not have ſetled you where you are, and have bound
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53333:87"/>you there to abide in love and peace, and in a dependence on him for his preſence and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; to your wrong and prejudice, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection intimates. This objection ſets the Precepts and Orders of God, at diſcord and variance with his promiſes of his preſence and bleſſings with his people. For if he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned you to aſſemble together, and keep to your own fold, under the Teaching and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of your own Miniſters, as he hath done; and yet as you ſay, he bleſſes another Miniſtry in an other place, that hath no ſuch Relation to you, as your own hath. Then I ſay, if that were true (as it is not) that God doth ſo bleſs that ſtrange Miniſtry, only in purſuance of his promiſes ſo to do. And if ſo, then his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes calls you out of your place to enjoy the good of them elſewhere, when his Rules and Precepts direct and engage you, to wait on, and worſhip God in your own Church. But who, that are not under ſtrong prejudices and deluſion can believe it, that God ſhould deal ſo with his people? or who durſt affirm in cold blood, that the only wiſe and righteous God, is contrary to himſelf? or that his Laws ſhould thus contradict his promiſes, or that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples duty and work lyes in one place, and the good of the promiſes in another, or that they muſt do their duty in one place, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the bleſſings of the promiſes in another, at the ſame time; yet this, and much more is implyed and included in the Objection. Is not this a charging God with folly? can any men in their ſober moods believe indeed, the matter of their own Objection, or the reaſon of their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53333:88"/>pretence, for leaving their own Miniſters and Miniſtry, and the Congregation to which they are with, and by their own free conſent united? I think not, neither dare they ſay in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and fear of God; that they do ſo. But in truth, it is but a pretence to blind others eyes, and ſtop their mouths againſt their juſt reproofs, for want of better Arguments, which ſuch Tranſgreſſors are wholly deſtitute of; yet ſomething they will, and think they muſt ſay for themſelves, and the juſtifying of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly and ſcandalous practiſes, in deſerting their own choſen Teachers and Congregations; although it be never ſo abſurd and baſe. But ſad experience ſhews, what they profit by ſuch as they pretend to be more profitable to them, than their own Teachers are. Their words and carriages are loud proofs of it: or rather, that the Devils transforming themſelves into Angels of light to them, do, together with their own pride, prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perſwade and entice them to ſuch evil manners, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying practices: and to put a fair face on a foul matter, he helps them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt checks of Conſcience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of their Brethren, by ſuch ridiculous reaſons, or rather pretences, as theſe.</p>
               <p>They care not how they charge God: wrong their own Souls; ſtumble and offend their Brethren, grieve and ſadden their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and caſt contempt on the Church and the Miniſtry thereof, ſo they may thereby, but gratifie their own luſts, their pride and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; their humours and paſſions, and do what they pleaſe.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53333:88"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be tender of your Miniſters good Names, and endeavour to preſerve them in Credit and Reputation, to the utmoſt of your power, as you have opportunity.</hi> For this is the will of Chriſt, and your duty. If you are charged to <hi>honour them,</hi> and <hi>highly to eſteem them for their works ſake?</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Theſ. 5.12, 13. (as aforeſaid) then you are bound by the ſame Laws, to keep up and maintain their honour, credit and reputation among your own ſelves, and with others; and not hear them villified, ſlighted and contemned by <hi>Back biters,</hi> behind their backs, while you are lookers on, and hearers of it, and hold your Tongues, and ſpeak not for their vindication; as too many do. But rather joyn with them, and juſtifie ſuch wretches by their ſilence, and connivence (if not poſitively fall in with them) then ſhew their indignation againſt them, reſpect to, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of, and zeal for their Miniſters and their Miniſtry. It is well known, that when their good Names ſuffer, the Miniſtry of Chriſt in their hands ſuffers with them, and proves a great hindrance to the Goſpel: and we cannot be ignorant of Satans devices, and his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and deſign to obſtruct the Goſpel, and the profit of Souls, by ſtirring up evil Tongues, to blaſt their Reputation, who labour in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And the more faithful, diligent, ſincere and ſucceſsful they are, the more induſtriouſly will Satan, by his evil Inſtruments, purſue them with Reproaches; That ſo their labours may be rendred uſeleſs. Witneſs <hi>Jeremy, Paul,</hi> yea <hi>Christ himſelf,</hi> who were exceeding faithful, diligent, and uſeful in the World to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53333:89"/>men Yet how were they beſpattered with evil Tongues? and rendred unworthy Inhabitants of the World. And the ſame Spirit is ſtill working, and like Inſtruments ready to do the ſame work againſt your Miniſters now. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt do as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.12, 13. when he heard the mouths of men open againſt them, namely, ſtand up ſtoutly for their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſharply reprove their <hi>Back-biters,</hi> and wicked ſlanderers, and by no means give them any encouragement by your harkning to, or ſilence at them. Chriſt vindicated <hi>Joſhua</hi> againſt the Devils accuſation and Reproaches, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. ſo do you your Miniſters. But eſpecially, do not you, who are Church-Members, receive or entertain an accuſation againſt your Teachers at all, behind their backs, <hi>nor under two or three credible witneſſes,</hi> before their faces; nor be <hi>Whiſperers</hi> againſt, or <hi>Back-biters</hi> of them your ſelves, one to another. For that is ſuch horrible wickedneſs, as God, and their Lord and Maſter will moſt certainly revenge, and ariſe in due time to plead their cauſe againſt you, although he may ſeem to wink at it for a time. And know, that if your Miniſters know not your doings, yet God takes ſpecial notice of them, and will declare his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of them to your ſhame and ſorrow at laſt. Bleſſed <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> had his <hi>Whiſperers</hi> and <hi>Back-biters</hi> by the Walls, unknown to him, but God detected them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.30, 31, 32, 33. (read the words at large) They were a Generation that carried it ſmoothly and fairly to his face, but cruelly ſnarled at him behind his back, and ſet their venomous Teeth in his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53333:89"/>fleſh, as too many Profeſſors do now deal with their Teachers. Many Church-members do greatly pleaſe themſelves now, with talking to one another againſt their Teachers, behind their backs, and blame them for this and that, and ſo wipe their mouths and ſay they have done no evil. They can with delight hear them villified; receive and entertain falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them, from their bitter Enemies; yea, and report what they have heard to others alſo; and bleſs themſelves in their ſo doing. But let ſuch know, that they have done very abominably and unrighteouſly, and their ſin will aſſuredly find them out in Gods time. The Lord Jeſus charges you, that you <hi>receive not an accuſation againſt an Elder, under two or three witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.19. and yet they dare do it upon the back-biting accuſation of one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious Accuſer. God charges you to honour your Miniſters, and to uphold and maintain their Credit and Reputation in the Church and World, for his name and Goſpels ſake, and the good of Souls. But you dare ſtand by, and by your ſilence countenance their back-biting Reproachers, while you hear them diſcredit and diſhonour them, and that which is yet worſer, you give your poſitive conſent to their wickedneſs, and joyn Iſſues with them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, crediting and entertaining of what they ſay. God peremptorily charges you not to <hi>Whiſper againſt back-biters, nor ſpeak evil of any man, nor be a Tale-bearer,</hi> Levit. 19.16. Tit. 3.2. Jam. 4.11. Eph. 4.31. 2 Cor. 12.20. and particularly of Teaching-Rulers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.5. But you dare to do
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53333:90"/>it (as it were) in ſpight of God and your own Conſciences, of, and againſt your Elders. Oh! let your Miniſters good Names, be of great eſteem with you, and near and dear unto you. Be you very cheary and tender of them, and do not in any way, by any means, either by Omiſſion or Commiſſion, diſhonour or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit them. For by your ſo doing, you diſobey the will of God, and diſhonour him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that you hate your Miniſters, although you pretend to love &amp; honour them; that you contemn them, although you pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary never ſo much. Yea, you are guilty of real Murder, as I have abundantly proved from Scripture; in a book, entituled, <hi>The evil Tongue tryed and found guilty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Viſit your Miniſters often, and be not ſtrange, or ſtrangers to them; for that will much diſcourage them in their work.</hi> There is a <hi>near Relation</hi> between Paſtors and their Churches, which calls for frequent viſits; and your fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits, if free and voluntary, and the fruits of your love to them, and eſteem of them, eſpecially if well improved, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry refreſhing, comforting and encouraging to them. If they are freely willing to give you loving and profitable viſits; then ſo ſhould you to them; your Elders love your Company, and glad to ſee you free and open hearted in your converſes with them, about your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when ſeriouſly and meekly managed; and the contrary is very grievous and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to their Souls. For how can they think you love and eſteem them, when you will not vouchſafe (it may be) to give them a viſit, in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53333:90"/>a whole year together? or how can they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you profit by, and value their labours, when you are ſo exceeding ſhy of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſtrange in your carriages towards them; your voluntary viſits might be improved to great profit to both: and I am perſwaded, that the neglect of this is ſinful, and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle detrimental, or injurious to their Souls. As their work will not permit it, ſo 'tis unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that your Teachers ſhould alwayes go to you, if they will ſpeak with you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould come to them, as well as they go to you. Well then! encourage them, by your ſo doing, and you will reap the profit of it, as well as they. Let your love to them and eſteem of them; be ſeen in this, as well as in other expreſſions of them. For it is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo to do, as it is your duty to forbear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may diſcourage them, and do all you can to encourage and forward them in their work. But be ſure, that your viſits be not in vain, but to ſpiritual profit; And that they are indeed, the fruits of your cordial love to, and eſteem of them, or elſe they are no better than pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Images, and whited Sepulchres; and you will appear to be no better than <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were to him; <hi>who with their mouths did ſhew much love, but their hearts were of another mould,</hi> Ezek. 33.30. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Stand by them, and help to bear their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, when you know them, and they require your aſſiſtance. Bear ye one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.2. If you know them fall into, or under any Sin or Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſet your hand to lift them up again; If
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53333:91"/>they fall under afflictions, help to bear them for them. Be like the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> in this matter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. and not like the <hi>cruel Prieſt and Levite,</hi> who ſaw the wounded man lay weltring in his blood, and crying out of his wounds, and left him to ſhift for himſelf, 31.32. <hi>verſes,</hi> no, but ſhew your ſelves good <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> who ſimpathized with, and actually helped him in his diſtreſs, according to his need. If your Miniſters muſt ſimpathize with you, and help you in your needs, then you muſt do the ſame to them. Shew bowels of love and pity to them, and ſet your hands and ſhoulders too, to help them under their Sins, Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other Tryals and Afflictions; and if poſſible to lift them out of them. Are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached? help to bear their burdens. Are they perſecuted by men? help to bear their burdens. And do the like in all other weighty caſes for them. Oh! how many are there, who pretend highly for Heaven? but care not what becomes of their painful Miniſters. Who can hear of their troubles and ſorrowes, and <hi>Galio</hi> like, <hi>care for none of theſe things,</hi> nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly mind, whether they ſink or ſwim; but like <hi>Pauls</hi> pretended friends, who when they ſaw him in deadly danger, <hi>forſook him,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16. and left him to ſtand or fall by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Blame not their Miniſtry to one another, eſpecially behind their backs, neither ſlight and undervalue their gifts, graces, or any of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and labours, in and for the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may not in all things ſuit or pleaſe your humours, thoughts or opinions.</hi> For they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53333:91"/>are bound in their Adminiſtrations, to pleaſe Chriſt, and follow their own light and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their perſwaſions and conſciences in all things, for the Churches edification; and not to walk according to the judgments, will and pleaſure of their Church-Members, either in their Doctrine or Diſcipline. And thoſe Churches that will impoſe their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opinions on their Paſtors or Elders, and load them with burdens of work and duty, which the Lord Jeſus never commanded them, are in their ſo doing, no leſs than Tyrannical-Uſurpers over them. For if Elders may not impoſe any thing or matter on the Churches, <hi>but the yoke and will of Chriſt,</hi> much leſs may the Churches impoſe their own opinions on their Elders. We ſay, that it is too hard a matter for any man to pleaſe all men, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews, that it is as hard a matter for any Elders of Churches to pleaſe all their Members; but that one or other will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this, another at that; and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge their diſlike of this or that in them unto others, and endeavour to bring them into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of it alſo: And then to make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to tattle and talk of it one to another, until they have run themſelves into further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. Therefore Miniſters, may no further ſeek to pleaſe their Churches, then in and by their ſo doing, they may pleaſe Chriſt their Lord. And what that is, I ſhould think, that their Elders ſhould underſtand as well, if not better than they. Paul <hi>ſought not to pleaſe men, but God in his Miniſtry,</hi> Gal. 1.10. Some Profeſſors do delight themſelves in this evil
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53333:92"/>work, namely, in ſeeking matters, and making faults againſt their Elders, and then poſſeſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with their own inventions; and if they do not gratifie and pleaſe them in all things, they ſhall (be ſure) to pleaſe them in nothing. All their works are blame-worthy, in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But as this ſhews that they are acted by a Spirit of Pride and prejudice againſt their Elders, ſo they do thereby declare their own folly, and lay open their own nakedneſs, with a witneſs: yea, they diſhonour Chriſt, hinder the profit of their own and others Souls, by their ſo contemning his and their Miniſtry; and greatly grieve and ſtumble their Teachers, and cauſe them to walk up and down with ſad hearts. Therefore do you take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this evil, for the Devil will tempt you to it, that he may hurt your Souls, afflict your Teachers, and hinder the Goſpel; you ſhould commend and eſteem whatever is their vertue, whatever you may ſee lovely in them; and if you ſee any defects, or unavoidable weakneſſes in them, to caſt a mantle of love over them; and by all means endeavour to keep up in each others hearts, a due eſteem of, and reſpect unto them, and their Miniſtry, that the Goſpel be not hindred, but furthred and encouraged by your means.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Joyn with your Teachers, and that by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them your Concurrence and utmoſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in their endeavours to promote good things in, for the good of the Church; and do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or load ſuch overtures, deſigns and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of your Miniſters, by your abſence, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſputes, or by your ſullen ſilence there.</hi> When
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53333:92"/>they propound any matter to you for your profit, and the welfare of your Souls, the peace and proſperity of the Church, or the benefit of others: then weigh and ponder well the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which they give, for what they do, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould be done, or omitted, by themſelves or the Church, or altogether; and if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not null and anſwer them, or bring better for the contrary; then you ſhould quietly, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and peaceably accept of theirs, acquieſce in them, and encourage them in their deſign, and not put difficulties in the way, by ſome ſingular notions of your own. Do as <hi>Nathan</hi> did, when <hi>David</hi> propounded a caſe to him, and told him, that it was meet God ſhould have a houſe built for his Name and Worſhip, and gives him ſome reaſon for his propoſition. <hi>Nathan</hi> replyes, <hi>Go, do all that is in thy heart,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. He ſaw it a moſt reaſonable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an undertaking, and freely complyed with <hi>David,</hi> and encouraged him to go on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. WHy ſhould not you comply with your Teachers? when they deſign and propound ſome good work, to be carried on, for the glory of Chriſt, and benefit of his Church, or other men? and why ſhould not their reaſons be ſoberly and humbly conſidred of by you, and oblige you to practiſe, unleſs you can null them, and with peace and meekneſs propound better to them for their ſatisfaction. It is ſad when Members of Churches ſhall be ſo highly conceited of themſelves, and their own Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that they ſhall deſpiſe and turn (as it were) a deaf ear to all the reaſons of their Elders, and delight in being ſingular from them
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53333:93"/>and their fellow-Brethren, in Church-matters: and in contending for Victory, rather than for Truth. This ought not to be. For it makes Church-work tedious, ſpoyls the beauty and lovelineſs of it; yea it marrs the Harmony of Church order. And this is diſhonourable to Chriſt, and the Church; and exceedingly grievous to your Teachers: who do unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek and aim at your good in all; and dare not do otherwiſe for fear of offending Chriſt their Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Encourage them with your Purſes alſo. For it is the will of Chriſt that you ſhould do ſo. They labour for your Souls, and ſpend their time and ſtrength to do you all poſſible ſervice, in their places and capacities; and therefore it is moſt reaſonable that you ſhould labour and provide for their bodies.</hi> They ſpend for you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould ſpend for them. They are Shepherds; do watch over and wait on you, their Flocks. And I appeal to any indifferent Judgment, if it be not a moſt reaſonable thing, that <hi>they ſhould live by the milk of their Flocks?</hi> ſurely! <hi>Paul,</hi> yea the Holy Ghoſt thought ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, 8. and therefore have declared it, for our Learning and practiſe. It was Gods Ordinance under the old Teſtament, and it is ratified and confirmed to men, under and by the new Teſtament alſo; namely, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be honourably and comfortably maintained, by their Congregations. The Great God took ſpecial care about it, and made proviſions for their maintenance, aſſoon as he had ordained and ſet them up, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ſet them out their work. And
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53333:93"/>God ſtrictly-charged his people, to ſee that they did not at any time <hi>forget or neglect the Levite,</hi> but pay them all that he had ſet out and appointed for them, and that then, when by reaſon of Age, or other impediments, they could not Miniſter to them, and for them, as well as when they did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.6. to the 14. <hi>vers. Numb.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.2.15. <hi>vers. Deut.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.1, 9. Now Gods care of, and goodneſs to his <hi>Embaſſadours,</hi> did not dye with the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> but he hath continued it under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and therein ſtraitly charged his people to provide for them, according to their abilities. God commands his people to communicate to their Teachers in all good things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that Teacheth, in all good things.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. The Apoſtle aſſures us, that it is not of men, but a <hi>real and unchangeable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> now, by, and under the Goſpel. <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſo hath God ordained, that they that Preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> (Mark), it is ordained; God hath made it a Statute. Law, that cannot be altred, neither may it be tranſgreſſed under pain of Gods high diſpleaſure. And the Apoſtle argues (by the Spirit) the juſtneſs, and the undoubted reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs and righteouſneſs of mens ſo doing, and that the evidence of meer Reaſon, and the Dictates of natural Conſcience, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written Law or Goſpel, will abundantly prove, and undeniably conclude this Truth, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever, 7.10. <hi>verſes.</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:53333:94"/>And proves, that it is not matter of gift or charity, (as it is to give to men in diſtreſs, to whom we are not endebted nor related) but that it is debt and juſtice; or a due debt in ſtrict Juſtice: and that by a threefold Law, (viz.) <hi>The Law of Nature, the written Law of God,</hi> in the old Teſtament; <hi>and the new Law or Goſpel,</hi> as in this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from the 5. to the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> he evinces, ſo in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27. And ſays the Apoſtle in 1 Cor. 9.11. <hi>v. If we have ſowen to you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, if we ſhall reap your carnal things.</hi> As if he had ſaid, alaſs! Theſe are but light, ſmall and low matters that you give us, for our pains and labours, in compariſon of what we do for and diſpenſe to you. Your carnal things, that you impart to us for our bodies, are not comparable to our labour, pains and care to impart ſpiritual Riches to your Souls. And therefore if you grudge at your parting with yours to us, know, that you grudge us ſmall and very inconſiderable things, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what we diſtribute to you. This is another of your works and duties to your Teachers. You muſt therefore do it, and that 1. Chearfully and willingly, not grudgingly; heartily, not hypocritically and indifferently: dutifully, and in obedience to the will of Chriſt, not as an arbitrary thing, that you may, or may not do, at your own will and pleaſure; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and perſeveringly, not for ſome time onely. And ſee that your ends be right in it, namely, to encourage your Miniſters, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Goſpel; to profit Souls, to ſerve, pleaſe and honour the Lord Jeſus; and that in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53333:94"/>the right performance of your duty to Chriſt &amp; his Miniſters, you may enjoy the good of the promiſes, and the bleſſings of all Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances adminiſtred by them.</p>
               <p>But that I may a little more inforce this on your Conſciences, be pleaſed to conſider, Firſt, <hi>That your Miniſters are appointed, commanded, and they do wholly attend on Chriſt, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your Souls.</hi> They are ſaid to <hi>wait at the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13. and commanded <hi>to give themſelves wholly to their work of Teaching, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Reading, Meditation, Study, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that their profiting may appear to all: that they may rightly divide the word of Truth, and that by ſo doing, they may both ſave themſelves, and them that hear them,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, 14, 15, 16. 2 Tim. 2.15. They muſt <hi>Preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 1.2. <hi>Feed their Flocks, and take the care and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of them,</hi> Act. 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. And therefore you muſt take care of their bodies, on whom they attend. For you ſee that they may not, cannot follow other Employments to get Bread, becauſe they are commanded to do other work for you, &amp; the greatneſs &amp; difficulty of their own proper work, neceſſitates them to wait on, and attend to it with all diligence. Therefore you ought to provide for them, all ſuitable ſupplyes, becauſe they cannot, may not do it themſelves. (2.) Conſider, <hi>that you are plainly and peremptorily commanded, and charged to Communicate to them, in, and of all your carnal things,</hi> as you heard before. And therefore you are by Chriſts Authority, and revealed will, indiſpenſibly bound to do it, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53333:95"/>that without grudging or gain-ſaying. For a plainer, and a more Indiſpenſible dury is not impoſed upon you (who are able) in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and therefore you cannot plead ignorance, for the breach or neglect of it. And if you do not obey your God and King in this, as well as in other things; how can you be called, <hi>obedient Children,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14. and how ſhall Chriſt commend you, as he did <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for <hi>walking in all his Commandments and Ordinances, blameleſly?</hi> Luk. 1.6. Or how can you expect that Chriſt ſhould ſay unto you, <hi>well done good and faithful ſervants?</hi> You have done that which was your duty to do: when you know, that you lived in the wilful neglect of a known and eaſie duty? (3.) Conſider, <hi>that God takes ſpecial notice of your doings and carriages towards his Embaſſadors, and your Teachers.</hi> He is privy to all your wayes; and will abundantly reward all your kindneſſes and unkindneſſes to them, and that becauſe they are his and yours. Therefore, be careful to demean and carry your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them ſo, as that the Lord Jeſus may ſay to you, <hi>well done good and faithful Servants, you have been kind and good, reſpectful and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to my Miniſters, and to me in them.</hi> And therefore I will recompence all your work of faith and labour of love to them. For what you did to them, as they were my Miniſters, you did to me; I take all, as done to my ſelf, <hi>enter into the joy of your Lord.</hi> Theſe are ſome, and but ſome of the Churches duties towards their Paſtors, or Teaching-Elders. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have been larger on this head than I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53333:95"/>intended, yet I forbear ſpeaking any more, leſt ſome ſhould think, I ſay too much.</p>

The <hi>Texts</hi> that ſpeak moſt clearly in the caſe, are in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. In <hi>Timothy,</hi> they ſeem to be expreſly diſtinguiſhed from Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruling-Elders: <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well, be counted worthy of double honour; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> This eſpecially, refers to ſuch Ruling-Elders, whoſe work and main buſineſs is to Teach, and who are eſpecially therefore, worthy of double honour, for that they have a double work and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53333:96"/>Office, namely, Teaching and Ruling. But the firſt part of the words ſpeaks of meer Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Elders, who in the faithful, diligent, and conſcientious diſcharge of their Office and Truſt in the Church, are counted worthy of double honour, and ought to be honoured and reſpected as ſuch, by the Church; not as they are Elders, but Elders who mind their buſineſs, and perform their work well and faithfully, as becomes Stewards of the houſe of God. In the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the words are theſe: <hi>He that Ruleth with diligence.</hi> In the 6. and 7. <hi>verſes,</hi> we have the Apoſtle ſpeaking to another ſort of Officers, namely, Teachers; whoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work is to Propheſie, Miniſter and Teach. And therefore (ſays he) let ſuch wait on that part of their work. Then he comes to another ſort of Officers, and theſe ſayes he, are to <hi>Rule with diligence:</hi> Not to attend to Teaching, as the others were to do, but to Ruling, and that with diligence; whereby he diſtinguiſheth the one from the other, and ſhews that they are diſtinct perſons and Officers from the Teachers, before mentioned. In like manner, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to me, to point out this ſort of Office and Officers, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, Secondarily Prophets, Thirdly Teachers; then Helps, Governments.</hi> Now what ſhould theſe helps, Governments be, as here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſtinguiſhed from teaching Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but this ſort of Ruling-Elders, I am ſpeaking of? For as every Church of Chriſt needs Teaching, ſo alſo Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline for their order and well being. But
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53333:96"/>becauſe the Teaching Elders cannot attend continually to their Ruling work (becauſe their Teaching and Miniſtring other Ordinances diverts them from it) ſo often as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; therefore hath God ſet in his Churches meer Ruling Elders, that they, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> his 70. Elders) may help to bear the burden, and aſſiſt the Teaching-Elders in the Diſcipline and Government of the Church. And therefore they are in the <hi>Corinths, joyned to the Teaching Ruling-Elders,</hi> (and alſo in the <hi>Romanes</hi>) and they are expreſly called <hi>Helps, Governments,</hi> for that they are given of God, to help their Teachers or Paſtors in the Government of the Church. And truly it hath its weight with me, namely, the neceſſity of ſuch Officers in the Churches, to help their Paſtors in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof. For as Satan is more buſie and vigilant in the Churches, to cauſe diſorders therein, than in any other Societies of men; So there is the more need of diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government and Inſpection, to keep all in order. And as was ſaid before, the Teaching-Elders cannot ſo conſtantly attend to the work of Diſcipline, becauſe of their other work, as need requires; therefore there is a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity of meer Ruling-Elders, to help and aſſiſt them, in the well Ordering and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church. Thus we ſee, that there are ſuch Officers, and ſuch an Office in the word of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>For what ends hath God ſet Ruling-Elders in his Church, and what is their Office, Work, and Power there?</hi>

                  </gap> matter, namely, of their work, uſe and ends for which they are ſet in the Church, particularly; yet if it be clear, that ſuch an Office, and Officer diſtinct from the Teachers, are given to, and ſet in the Church, by the Lords appointment; and that they are Authorized and Empowred by Chriſt, to Act and Officiate there, in his Name, then (I ſay) it is certain, they have their ſpecial work to do there; for they are not ſet there to have a Name, and ſignifie nothing elſe, but they have their work there, as ſuch, which they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to attend unto, for the benefit of the Church, and the glory of Chriſt their Lord. Now what their work and buſineſs is, I ſhall ſearch out, and diſcover, as well as I can, and that with all poſſible brevity.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, they are expreſly called Ruling-Elders, or Elders that Rule, in the Scripture. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Now what doth their Name and Office ſignifie and imply, but that they are to aſſiſt their Teachers in the orderly Government of the Church, (as was ſaid before). And I think their work lies chiefly in theſe Ten things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In looking after the Converſations of ſuch, as propound themſelves to joyn with the Church, that the Church admit not any ſcandalous perſons amongſt them</hi> That if they are ſuch, they may be debarr'd and kept out; if otherwiſe (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other qualifications) they may be received in. This I judge to be one part of their work. For certainly, it is one part and end of Church-power, to keep the Church clear from ſcandal and offence. And they

In the abſence, or upon the deſire of the Paſtor, they may admit or take Members into the Church, or rather take them into Church-Memberſhip, by giving them the right hand of fellowſhip, and ſhewing them their duty and priviledge in a Church-State. And herein they repreſent the Church, and act Authoritatively therein for them. This is another part of their Office, VVork and Power. And it requires good abilities, to do it well, and to purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may when need requires, command ſpeech and ſilence in Church-meetings, for the preventing of Diſorders and diſorderly Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in their words and carriages, and they may authoritatively and publickly admoniſh and reprove ſuch in the face of the Church, which private Brethren may not do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may in ſome caſes, with the conſent of their Paſtor or Teacher, (if at home) call and aſſemble the Church together, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſome apparant evil, or promoting of ſome good thing or work in the Church. Or in caſe the Paſtor ſhall knowingly neglect to do his duty in the caſe, or caſes aforeſaid, doubtleſs, the Ruling-Elders may and ought to do it; and the Church ought to obey their call. For they do it by the Authority they have from Chriſt, for the good and benefit of the Church. But this may not be done by any Member, that is not an Elder, but in the want of an Elder. And when they are aſſembled together, they may authoritatively propound
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53333:98"/>the cauſes and ends for which they called them there, and require their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Their work is to inſpect, and carefully, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, wiſely and faithfully to look after the walkings and converſations of all the Members of the Church.</hi> This is the <hi>chief part</hi> of their work. They are not only to take cognizance of what is brought to them, by others Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but to enquire after them. They are bound by virtue of their Place and Office, to ſee if the Members keep cloſe to Church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reverently attend them, and if they do not, to Reprove, Admoniſh &amp; Exhort them, to Teach and Inſtruct them. That they may know their duty; be convinced of their ſinful neglects, repent of and amend them, and that by their good Counſels and Exhortations, they may be provoked and encouraged to, and in their work. Ruling-Elders, ſhould <hi>in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as alſo in comforting the afflicted, and ſpeaking words in ſeaſon to him that is weary, be able, and alſo (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) apt to Teach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. as well as the Paſtors. The one more privately and particularly, and the other more publickly. For as the Deacons work is to look after the wants and corporal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, and provide for the poor, and the Teachers to mind and look after the concernments of their Souls, and make proviſions for them according to their needs; So Ruling-Elders have their work, namely, to look after the manners of all the Members of the Church. To encourage and ſtrengthen the hands of the Tractable and Obedient, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53333:98"/>to reprove, convince, and perſwade the Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; that they may do what they ought.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And therefore, they ſhould often viſit them, and ſee how they do, and how they walk; what they want, and wherein they need their aſſiſtance, and helping hand;</hi> and when they know it, to hold it out unto them, freely and readily. Certainly Elders ſhould be intimately acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Congregations, and with their walkings alſo. For if any miſcarry through their default or neglect, the guilt will lie at their Doors, and the Lord Jeſus will require it at their hands. Oh! that Elders would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oufly conſider it, and lay this matter near their hearts, and ſuffer it to penetrate and pierce their Conſciences; and that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in good earneſt, wherefore they are ſet in the Church, and for what ends they have Rule and Diſcipline put into their hands: That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deep Convictions, they may be induced to diſcharge their work, and perform their Truſts, mind their Duty, and proſecute the ends of their appointment; that God may be well pleaſed with, and bleſs them, own and delight to uſe them, for his glory in the Church; and that they receiving benefit by their wiſdom, diligence and faithfulneſs, may rejoyce in, and bleſs God for them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>They muſt take up Controverſies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to end ſtrifes and debates in the Church, when ſuch evils happen;</hi> which are found too frequent, through the Pride and prejudice of our hearts, and the Temptations of the Devil; who is a great Adverſary to the Peace, Beauty, Order and Proſperity of Churches. Ruling-Elders
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53333:99"/>muſt not ſuffer any quarrels, or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either in publick or private, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a few or many, but preſently interpoſe their VViſdom and Authority to decide and reconcile the cauſes and perſons, and ſet all in joynt again. For ſuch evils if let alone, will prove like Cancers in the body, and encreaſe to more ungodlineſs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Therefore the Elders ſhould enquire into them, and ſearch out ſuch as did the wrong, began the ſtrife, and ſuch as they find are adicted to take up prejudices againſt, and foment debates with their Brethren; and correct the offenders, and releive the wronged and oppreſſed, as they ſee cauſe. There muſt be no <hi>Hammer, no knocking heard in the Temple of God.</hi> And <hi>wee</hi> to them who give occaſion for ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and to ſuch as do improve occaſions in ſuch a manner, alſo; ſo likewiſe, <hi>to negligent and careleſs Elders,</hi> who do, or may know theſe evils, and yet let them alone, or ſeek to heal them in a ſlight manner, as if they had nothing to do with them, or were not indeed much concerned in them. But ſurely, this is one of your great works, as you have the power of Rule and Government in your hands, for the good of the Church. And you may authoritatively take up Controverſies, and require the Members of the Church to hearken to you. And you may do Chriſt and the Church great ſervice, in this matter. Therefore mind it in good earneſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Their work is to aſſiſt and encourage the Teaching-Elders, and to promote and ſet forward the Goſpel in their hands.</hi> They muſt ſtand by,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53333:99"/>and ſtand up for their Teachers, and not ſuffer them to be wronged, obſtructed, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by any, ſo far as they can prevent it, by their power and wiſdom. Do any back-bite them? Rprove them. Do any ſlight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn their Miniſtry? Reprove them, &amp; ſhew them the evil of it, &amp; whence it is. And they ſhould aſſiſt and help them with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Advice and Counſel, when deſired, and need requires it. Moreover, they ought to do all they can to make the Miniſtry of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers acceptable unto the Church, and to ſee that all do their Duties to them. That they defraud not their Teachers of convenient and due maintenance, nor carry themſelves rudely and diſreſpectfully unto them, or towards their Miniſtry: and that they warn and exhort them to do their Duty to them, as Chriſt hath commanded. That they conſtantly, ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and reverently attend to, and wait on their Miniſtry, and to make holy earnings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They ought to project and prepare good orders and matters for the profit of the Church, to help forward and promote any good things preſented to them by their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and help to carry them on, unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in an eſpecial manner they ſhould concur with them, in promoting <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>the power of godlineſs</hi> in the Church: and that by Counſel, Inſtruction and Exhortation. <hi>For that is the Churches Ornament, Beauty and Glory,</hi> Pſal. 93. <hi>ult.</hi> They ſhould labour to promote, Goſpel-light, life, zeal, humility, meekneſs and good works. They ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53333:100"/>to promote Godlineſs in the Churches Families, in their hearts, and converſations among t men, and in their Meetings and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, to the utmoſt of their power, and not leave all to their Paſtors to do. They are indeed indiſpenſibly bound to promote it all they can, by their Preaching and walking; and that publickly and privately; and Ruling-Elders are to do it privately, and particularly. And becauſe the frequent Meetings of Chriſtians for Prayer and Diſcourſe, is a Duty exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable and beneficial unto their Souls, when rightly improved, wiſely and ſpiritually managed; the Elders ſhould encourage it, ſet it forward, and endeavour to maintain and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch good VVorks and Duties amongſt all the Members of the Church. For ſuch Meetings, will greatly promote Godlineſs, and keep a Savour of Chriſt on the heart. Now who ſhould promote and further this good work, ſo much as the Elders; who may and ought authoritatively to do it? This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their works and buſineſſes in the Church. Therefore ſee you do it in good earneſt, who are Elders.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly: Ruling-Elders (as well as Teaching) have another great work to do in and for the Church: and that is to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exemplary in their words, deeds and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. <hi>Be thou an example</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> 1 Epiſtle, 4.12.) <hi>to the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity:</hi> for without theſe things all the reſt is worth nothing at all. Elders and their VVives and Children (as well as the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53333:100"/>Deacons) ſhould be examples and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Patterns of Meekneſs and humility</hi> to others, in their Garbs or cloathings. Elders ſhould be ſingular in wiſdom, zeal, ſeriouſneſs and gravity; in love, ſweetneſs, diligence, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſpirituallity, Heavenly mindedneſs, and in all good works. <hi>Shew thy ſelf</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>a Pattern of good works in all things,</hi> Tit. 2.7. They muſt ſo walk, as that others may ſafely follow their ſteps, and be excited and encouraged ſo to do, by their examples. They are indiſpenſibly bound to be good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of, and in the Congregation or Church, when aſſembled together to worſhip God. Then ſhould the Elders ſhew good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the whole Church, by their timely coming there, and by their holy, ſerious and reverent carriages and deportments in the worſhip of God. For when they neglect their place and duty there, or come unſeaſonably, carry themſelves careleſly and unreverently; they tempt others to do ſo too. For as they are Elders over the Church, and have a Name among them; ſo they eye them much, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great things of and from them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Elders muſt take heed to their wayes, and ſee that they <hi>walk circumſpectly,</hi> (or exactly) <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. For if they do not, believe it, they will do more hurt than good in the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that Ruling Elders have work enough to do in the Church, and that there is need and uſe enough of them. And ſurely, they might be of great uſe in the Church, and prove a great bleſſing indeed to her, would they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53333:101"/>but know, mind, attend to and do their own proper work and buſineſs, and really concern themſelves with Chriſt's, and the Churches concernments, with all their hearts and ſouls; as they ought to do. And oh! that ſuch as are called to that Office and Dignity, would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider and lay to heart their wayes and doings, wherefore they are ſet in the Church, and inveſted with Power and Authority, and whether they do indeed intend, and in good earneſt ſet to their work, and unfeignedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and proſecute thoſe ends?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould Ruling-Elders perform their work in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, with wiſdom, or wiſely. They ſhould wiſely obſerve the matters they have, to concern themſelves about, and to manage in the Church. 2. The <hi>times and ſcaſons</hi> for the doing of them; to whom, and when. 3. The <hi>manner</hi> how they ſhould or ought to do them. Much light, knowledge, and ſpiritual wiſdom is required in Church Government, and Governours. And therefore, they have great need to pray, read and ſtudy much, for Divine wiſdom, and Spiritual underſtanding in theſe things. That they may diſcern the will of Chriſt their Lord and Law-giver, and not miſtake their way and work; nor the times, ſeaſons and occaſions thereof, nor ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at any ſtumbling-ſtone, or walk in the dark, in ſo great and importunate matters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The revealed will of Chriſt in his New Teſtament,</hi> is to be their great and <hi>only Rule and Guide</hi> in Church-matters No other voice muſt be heard there, but his; nor any other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53333:101"/>Authority, Law, or Rule to be obſerved, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and obeyed, but his. It is <hi>given to him, to be the Head over all things to his Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22, 23. And therefore, they ought to <hi>obſerve all things, whatſoever he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them,</hi> (and nothing elſe) Math. 28.20. in the exerciſe of their Authority, in or for the Church. This they muſt carefully and continually mind, and have in their eye, that they do not their own wills, and walk by their own Rules, but Chriſts. For in ſo doing he will bleſs and proſper them, help and aſſiſt them: and in the end he will reward all their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and obedience to his holy will. But otherwiſe he will ſay, who required theſe things of you. Therefore, when any caſes or works are offered to you; you muſt conſider them, and the Laws or Rules by which you ought to proceed, in what you are called to do: and then proceed and manage your work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Be you ſure to ſteer your courſe aright by Divine light and Laws; look up to, and own Chriſt and his Authority in all your proceedures. For you act not as <hi>civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> in a ſtate, but as the <hi>Spiritual Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> of Chriſt in his Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) it is his Will and Authority only, that you muſt obſerve and walk by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Diligently:</hi> you muſt exerciſe your power with all poſſible diligence, Rom. 12.8. <hi>He that Ruleth with diligence.</hi> That is, he muſt frequently attend to his Ruling-work, and what he doth therein, he muſt do with all his abilities. He muſt be earneſt and fervent in it, and ſet himſelf to it, as to his work and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53333:102"/>buſineſs. He muſt not be ſlothful, negligent, or careleſs in it, as if it were an indifferent thing; no, but he ought to be <hi>diligent, and fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> in what he doth, Rom. 12.11. <hi>The negligent ſervant ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. 12 47. They ſhould be <hi>diligent to know the ſtate of their Flocks,</hi> Prov. 27.23. For although, they (I mean the Church) are not the Ruling Elders Flock, as they are the Teaching Ruling Elders, yet they are in a ſenſe, their Flock and charge, to watch over them, and inſpect their manners and walkings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Readily; willingly, and chearfully.</hi> They ſhould be like the Teaching-Elders in this alſo, 1 Pet. 5.2. <hi>Taking the overſight of the Flock, not by conſtraint, but willingly; not as Lords over Gods Heritage, but examples to the Flock.</hi> It is ſad indeed, when they look not after them, nor mind their work and Office in the Church, but when they are conſtrained, and as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it, by their Teachers, and cannot for ſhame but do ſomething then, but ſomewhat unwillingly, coldly and indifferently; as if it were a ſmall thing, or a matter by the by: and which they would not trouble themſelves about, could they handſomely evade and paſs it by. They grudge at it, and account it their burden, not their delight. But ſurely, it ſhould be their delight to ſerve Chriſt and his Church; and they ſhould moſt readily, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearfully do it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſcientiouſly and Dutifully.</hi> The will of Chriſt and their duty: their work and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do good, ſhould lye deep in their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53333:102"/>hearts, and powerful on their Conſciences; and what they do in the Church, in purſuance of their Truſt and Office-power, for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and his Church; they are bound to do it upon Choice, conſcientiouſly and dutifully: and that, becauſe it is their place, work and duty, by virtue of Chriſt's Authority, who hath for theſe ends ſet them in the Church; appointed and enjoyned them ſuch work and ſervice there: for his glory and their good. They muſt not only bear Rule, but they muſt <hi>Rule well too,</hi> for thoſe ends; or elſe they are of no uſe and ſervice there. Now how can they be ſaid to Rule well, as commanded; unleſs they uſe and exerciſe their Office-power ſo; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſely, diligently, readily and willingly; chearfully, conſcientiouſly and dutifully, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws and Rules of Chriſt their Lord?</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ought to exerciſe their Authority, and uſe their power in the Church, with much <hi>love, tenderneſs, meekneſs, impartiality;</hi> and ſometimes (as need requires) <hi>with ſeverity</hi> too. They muſt not exalt themſelves, and carry it in a Lordly manner towards their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe they have Authority over, and may command them But they muſt ſee that they temper their power, and the exerciſe and uſe of it with love, tenderneſs, humility and meekneſs. They ſhould ſo carry themſelves in all things, as that on the one hand they be not ſlighted and deſpiſed, and on the other hand, envied for their haughtineſs. They ſhould ſo behave themſelves in the houſe of God, as that they may give occaſion to all, to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53333:103"/>think that they love them, and reſpect their good, in all they do. So likewiſe they ought to be juſt and impartial in their proceedures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, and not reſpect perſons in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the merit of the cauſe. And in caſe of neceſſity, when they have to do with ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and obſtinate perſons; they may and ought to be ſevere, in dealing with them, when they cannot otherwiſe prevail on them, to convince, humble and reform them, <hi>Jude</hi> 22.23.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And in all their endeavours, ways and practiſes in the Church, they ſhould <hi>intend, deſign and aim at the union, peace, holineſſe, comfort and proſperity of the Church;</hi> the honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, encouragement of the Goſpel and the Glory of Chriſt. All which bleſſed ends they ſhould wiſely, zealouſly, ſincerely, ſeriouſly, induſtrouſly and faithfully proſecute, and with all their might ſtrive and labour to obtain; and by all means, and that with much patience and perſeverance, in the uſe of them, hope and pray, ſeek and wait to accompliſh; in the Lords time. They muſt not make one or two attempts to reconcile differences, rectify diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, diſſwade from Sin, perſwade to Duty; to heal wounds and encourage to Repentance, and ſo leave it, without looking after the Iſſue and the ſucceſs of their labours, but they muſt follow on their work until the ends be obtained. They, (as well as their teaching Elders) muſt <hi>look well to their herds, Prov.</hi> 27.23. They muſt ſee, that <hi>they rule well, and with diligence;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. and that they approve themſelves faithfull Stewards to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53333:103"/>Chriſt and his Church, in all their proceedings; and make full proof thereof.</p>
               <p>Queſt, <hi>What are the qualifications of ruling Elders, or how ſhould they be qualifyed, for ſo high and honourable work and office in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall briefly name ſome of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualifications; and but ſome of them, and ſuch as are indeed neceſſary for them; without which, they cannot, will not rule well, nor be profitable to the Church. Firſt, They muſt be qualified <hi>with Spiritual Gifts and ſpecial Graces: with a conſiderable meaſure of divine Wiſdome and Spiritual underſtanding.</hi> They ſhould be, not only real Saints, but eminent Saints too. They muſt not only have peculiar Grace, but be ſtrong in Grace alſo. Surely! they ought to be well furniſhed with the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, that they may go in and out; and walk in the Church as ſhining Lights; be able to judge and diſcern caſes and perſons, and make a ſound and true Judgment of the things and matters they may be called to judge and determine. They muſt not be <hi>Novices</hi> in the knowledge of Chriſt, his Law &amp; Goſpel (the Rules by which they muſt walk); but they muſt have the <hi>Word of Chriſt, to dwell in them richly, in all Wiſdom; Col.</hi> 3.16. to help them in their work. They cannot rule well, unleſſe they do underſtand and can ſpeak well; nor unleſſe they are well acquainted with their Office, Work, and the Rules thereof. They ought to be ſober, grave and ſerious Perſons, and not of vain, light and frothy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, in their ſpirits &amp; carriages. They ſhould be of prompt ready minds and ſpirits for their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53333:104"/>work, and not of dull, lumpiſh and heavy Tempers. For if they are ſuch, they will not act upon choice freely, but by conſtraint, and that will render them unprofitable and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to the Church. They ſhould be men of blameleſſe lives, and ſpotleſſe converſations; and they ſhould be men of warm and lively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, abounding in Love, zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Spirit. They ought to be <hi>men of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, fearing God,</hi> (like Moſes his 70 Elders) <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. and be free from notorious and apparent Coveteouſneſs and worldly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They ſhould be eminent in humility and meekneſs, and in other Graces of the Spirit; and they ſhould be men of pitty, compaſſion, of bowells and mercies, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. They muſt not be angry paſſionate perſons, or men of ſower, froward and peeviſh Spirits and carriages: for theſe abominations will very much blemiſh them, and cauſe prejudices in the minds of Obſervers. They muſt not be Tattlers, Medlers, nor Buſy-bodies in other mens matters; neither ſhould they be ſlothful, negligent or careleſs of their own. Theſe are ſome of their neceſſary qualifications.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the Duties of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and how ought they to demean and carry themſelves towards their Ruling Elders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When they do <hi>rule well,</hi> and uſe their office, power, <hi>diligently, faithfully and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, for the peace, wellfare and proſperity of the Church,</hi> the encouragement of the Miniſtry, propagation of the Goſpel, and the honour and Glory of Chriſt, as they are indiſpenſibly bound to do: they are <hi>worthy of double Honour,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:53333:104"/>Love and reſpect from the Church: and they ought to give it to them, heartily and ſincerely; in obedience to Chriſt, who injoyns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. as alſo for their work and office ſake, and for the Lord Chriſt his Sake, whoſe Officers they are; whoſe Image they bear, and whoſe work and ſervice they do, and are employing themſelves in. They muſt have, not only ſimple honour, love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from you; but double. They muſt have much more then any private brethren have, <hi>when they rule well,</hi> and that upon a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account. 1. As they are Chriſt's and your Elders and Officers; and in a ſenſe, do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to you in and by their work and office-power in the Church. 2. As, or becauſe they rule well, and uſe their office-power for your profit and benefit. Do they carefully, diligently and induſtrouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and follow their work, and ſeek your good? then remember, that you owe them double honour, love and reſpect; and ſee you give it to them. Moreover, Church-members ſhould yield them their chearful ſubjection and obedience, to all their Lawfull commands and appointments for their good, and give them all poſſible encouragement in their work, and not weaken their hands and make their work heavy, and burdenſome to them; but do all they can to make it eaſy and ſweet to them; that ſo they may do it with Joy and not with Grief. You ſhould alſo pray importunately for them, that God would make them able, willing and faithfull to and in their work, and bleſſe and proſper their labours with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53333:105"/>Do they mind their work, and labour for your good? why then it is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that you ſhould mind them, and give them their dues, that they may be encouraged in their work and diligence, by your duty to them. In a word, you ſhould carry your ſelves towards them in all things, as to Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Chriſt's Officers to you, for your Good. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. for (ſays he) <hi>they are God's Miniſters to thee for good;</hi> ſo your ruling Elders are the Miniſters of Chriſt to you for good: Therefore behave your ſelves towards them, and do for them as ſuch. Not as they are El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among you, but as they are good Elders to you, and ſuch as rule well for your profit. Do they rule well, mind and attend to their work and duty? Why, then love, honour and reſpect them as ſuch. Do they labour with, and take pains among you; and are they dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſerious and faithfull in their office? then pray much for them; bleſſe and thank God for them; acknowledge, accept and eſteem of them; carry your ſelves ſubmiſſively &amp; obediently to them; ſtrengthen their hands and encourage their hearts, to and in their work; and do all you can and ought to do for them. Do they walk holyly, humbly, wiſely, zealouſly and fruitfully? do you follow their examples; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their ſteps, and as much as poſſible, write after their Copy; and by ſo doing you will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt, and comfort them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What other Officers hath Jeſus Chriſt ſet in his Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. Deacons.</hi> The Lord Jeſus hath in his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53333:105"/>great love to, and care of his Church, appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and given to them this ſort of officers alſo, for their comfort, profit and well being: and they need them likewiſe: For as the Teaching Elders may not attend moſtly to their ruling work, but to <hi>Study, Reading, Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;</hi> (and then not to ſerve Tables, <hi>Act</hi> 6.) ſo the Ruling Elders leave their work to attend two, which is not to ſerve Tables neither, but to look after other Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and concernments as you heard before. And therefore I ſay, that Deacons are neceſſary and uſefull Officers in the Church; and are diſtinguiſhed from other Officers, by their name and work there. The Inſtitution of this ſort of Officers in the Church, as alſo their work, uſe and qualifications, we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. ſo that we ſee there is ſuch an Office, and ſuch Officers are appointed for and ſet in the Church.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What manner of perſons ſhould deacons be, or what are their qualifications, by divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. They muſt be men of honeſt Report, full of the holy Ghoſt, and wiſdome,</hi> Acts 6.3. They muſt be <hi>grave, not double-tongued; not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy Lucre, holding the Myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſcience. Even ſo muſt their Wives be grave, not ſlanderers; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Faithful in all things. Ruling their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and their own houſes well,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.8, 9, 11, 12. Theſe are ſome of the neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of Deacons in the Church. You that are Deacons, mind theſe things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53333:106"/>ſeriouſly if you are ſo qualified for that Office in the Church of God. If you are not ſo qualified, humble your ſelves before the Lord, entreat him to qualify you with his holy Spirit, and labour in the uſe of all good means to obtain what is yet wanting in you, for the well and profitable performance of your work, as becomes ſuch Officers in a holy Church of Chriſt's.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the Deacons works in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In general, their work is to <hi>ſerve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Acts</hi> 6. But more particularly, 1. They are to provide for and diſtribute to the poor of the Church according to their neceſſities; <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and not to ſuffer any of them to want through their negligence. And therefore they ought to enquire what poor there are in the Church, and what their wants are, and accordingly to ſupply them. In order to which they ſhould receive the Churche's contributions, and wiſely conſider if what they do receive from them, will ſupply the wants of the poor, and ſatisfy other emergencies in the Church. And in caſe they do not, to acquaint one of the Elders, that he may ſpeak to the Church to augment their ſtock; that ſo they may have enough to ſupply all occaſions, as need requires. 2. They ſhould not only look after the poor to get money for them, from the Church: but to eaſe the Church, they ſhould ſee that ſuch as can work, and ſo help to maintain themſelves, do ſo: and ſuch as can work but will not (if any ſuch be) to reprove and admoniſh them; and untill they do ſet to work, and endeavour
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53333:106"/>to live and provide for themſelves as well as they can, to detain all ſupplies from them; that their wants may provoke them to labour. But in caſe there are any poor in the Church, that would labour, and not be chargeable to the Church, but cannot get employment; the Deacons ought to do their utmoſt from time to time, to get them work, and to give them all the encouragement they can therein. And by their ſo doing, they may be ſervicable to the Church, and to the poor, who would live by the labour of their own hands, if they could find employment: and who are as loath to be burdenſome unto the Church, as they are, that they ſhould be ſo. 3. They ſhould often viſit the poor and ſee how it is with them, encourage and comfort them, and do all they can to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their hands, and refreſh their hearts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their poverty, and the Temptations that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. Doubtleſs poverty hath many great and ſtrong Temptations; and therefore the poor have need of their ſupports, kindneſſes and encouragement, to bear up their hearts from ſinking deſpondencies. Surely! Deacons have more to do for the Church, and the poor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then to receive contributions and ſend it by others now and then to ſuch as want, when they are required ſo to do. What need is there of ſuch qualifications as the Goſpel requires in them, for their doing of that? If they have but eyes and common reaſon, they may do their work, if that be all, without any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid qualifications. But their requiſite qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations do declare ſufficiently that they have other work to do in the Church, for which they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53333:107"/>muſt be ſo qualified. But when men have once gotten the name of an Office, they take up with that, but ſeldome or never mind, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know and do the work of their office. They muſt be even driven to mind it, and angry if any tell them of their neglects. Surely! ſuch officers have a ſad account to make, and contract much blame, ſhame and guilt on their names &amp; Souls; and they muſt repent in Duſt and Aſhes, and even ſhed Tears of blood for their Sin, if ever they be Saved. Yea, the ſtraits, wants and Temptations of the poor, which are occaſioned by the Deacons neglects, will cry out againſt them, and condemn them. Oh! Sirs; remember whoſe Officers and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you are, and for what ends you are ſet in the Church; conſider your ways, what you ought to do; what you do, and what you leave undone. 4. They ſhould provide convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for the Church to worſhip God withall, and ſee that the Church ſuffer no detriment by any of their neglects. 5. Their work alſo is, to ſee that the Church perform that part of their duty to their Teacher or Paſtor; namely, to give him his due of ſubſiſtance, according to that charge, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27. and to collect it for him. To provoke the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and exhort ſuch as are backward to their duty. Their work being (as was ſaid) to ſerve Tables, this muſt needs be a part of it. And it is well known, that this work of the Church and Deacons, is neceſſary for the upholding and encourageing of the Miniſtry. Theſe are ſome of the Deacons workes in the Church, to which they ſhould attend with all poſſible
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53333:107"/>wiſdome, diligence and faithfulneſs, as their work and buſineſſe. For God will require an account of them, how they have carried themſelves in the Church, and performed their work there.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the duty of Church-members to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Deacons, in the Faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious diſcharge of their duty and truſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They ſhould love and honour them, as Chriſt's and their Officers, and give them all encouragement in their work. They muſt not load and burden their work, by diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, blaming or penuriouſneſs towards them: or by diſtruſting them, and ſpeaking contemptibly of them. But they ſhould chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confide in them, and pray importunately to God for them: that they may be enabled to do their work, and faithfully ſerve Chriſt, and his Church in their place, as they are bound to do. Surely, brethren, Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to ſee any of his Church-Officers, who act and ſerve the Church faithfully, from from and under him, and by his Authority and appointment, to be ſlighted undervalued and diſcouraged. But it is his Will that they ſhould be loved, honoured and reſpected, for his own, and their work and Office ſake; and that they ſhould find, all poſſible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from you. The neglect of which is Sin, and diſobedience againſt Chriſt's Laws and Authority, and your ſhame and loſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Of the great &amp; indiſpenſible duties of Church-members amongſt themſelves, or to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Church Relation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>WHat are the duties of Church-members to one another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are two great ends Chriſt Jeſus had in his Eye, in appointing and ordaining ſuch a near Relation, union and communion for, and among his people, as a Church-ſtate and relation is. Firſt, To capacitate and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to perform their reſpective dutys and works, 1. to God, 2. To men, or to one another. Secondly, to encourage them ſo to do, and that with greater eaſe, freedome, order and ſatisfaction, than otherwiſe they could do. By virtue of their near Relation to, and intimate acquaintance with one anothers perſons, faith, principles, and converſations, they can worſhip or <hi>glorify God together, with one mind and mouth,</hi> as commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. and walk together with God in all his ways, <hi>in the ſame mind and Judgement,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. which elſe they could not ſo well do. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to perform their reſpective Duties to their Officers, and mutual duties to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as brethren united together in a holy Band, for thoſe ends and purpoſes. Their duties to one another, as Brethren and Siſters enchurched, and knit together in one ſingle and individual Corporation, under the Laws and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53333:108"/>Lordſhip, Rule and Government of their only Head and Law-giver the Lord Jeſus, are all laid down in his Goſpel for them, and made their Duties only by his appointing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be obſerved and practiſed by all Church-members; and in all their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, they muſt have a choice and ſingular reſpect to his holy Will, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority in them; without which, their doing of them are not acts of Obedience to him, but the products of their own Wills and Pleaſures. Now then, we will enquire into them, endeavour briefly to bring them to light, and preſent ſome of them to you, who deſire to know and obey them in Truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The firſt and greateſt, is <hi>love,</hi> love and ſpiritual Affections are the holy Cords that tye the hearts, ſouls and judgments of Believers one to another. This is that, which (together with the fear of God) makes them avoid all things whatever may give juſt offence, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter griefe to one another, and that which provokes them to follow after the things that make for Peace, and the things that tend to Edification. Love is the <hi>Bond of Peace,</hi> Eph. 4.2, 3. 'Tis that which (together with Divine light and truth) cauſes Church-members to draw together, as in one yoke, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, as with one heart and ſoul, to deſign, aim at and carry on mutual and common good in the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Without this love one to another, they cannot, will not Cement, nor long abide and live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a Church in Peace and Unity, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any good work among themſelves; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53333:109"/>heart knitting-love one to another in the fear of God, they will receive and entertain Jealouſies and Suſpicions one of another, and put the worſt conſtruction on whatever is ſaid or done; and they cannot walk together com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and profitably to and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where and when they are entertained. Therefore it is abſolutely needful and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all Church-members, to be firmly Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſtantly joyned together in cordial love and charity; <hi>which is the Bond of Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to and in all other Duties, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. God highly commends, and ſtrictly commands this love one to another, and puts it into the hearts of his peculiar People, that they may do what he commands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God highly <hi>commends</hi> it wherever he finds it, in Act and Exerciſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.10. <hi>And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ye do it towards all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> Col. 1.4, 8. 2 Cor. 8.7. 1 Theſ. 1.3. to which Duty, (and to manifeſt his high approbation of it) God hath promiſed a great Reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God <hi>commands</hi> it, and vehemently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to, and urges it on them, almoſt every where in the Goſpel. Oh! how importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the Lord Jeſus enjoyn it, and frequently preſs it on his Diſciples, when he was on Earth? Joh. 13.34. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you:</hi> what is that new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? why, <hi>that ye love one another, as I have loved you; that ye alſo love one another.</hi> And in Joh. 15.12, 17. <hi>This is my Commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> That is, take the Pattern of my Love to you
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53333:109"/>for your love to, or in loving one another. I have, and do love you (1) with <hi>great</hi> love; <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. ſo do you likewiſe. (2) My love to you is <hi>free,</hi> without any deſert in you: let yours be free love, without carnal Reſpects, one to another alſo. (3) My love to you is <hi>real, hearty and unfeigned:</hi> So let yours be to one another alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. 1 Pet. 1.22. (4) My love towards you, is an exceeding <hi>fruitful love.</hi> I loved you ſo, as to labour, toyl, ſweat and dye for you. I loved you ſo, as to humble and debaſe my ſelf for you, and all to do you good: ſo muſt you love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a fruitful profiting love. For as I have loved you, ſo you muſt love each other. (5) My love to you, is a <hi>pitying, ſparing, and forgiving love; a forbearing and tender hearted love:</hi> ſo muſt yours be to one another, likewiſe <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13. (6) I love you with a <hi>warm and fervent love:</hi> ſo do you, <hi>love one another with pure hearts, fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. (7) I love you with a <hi>holy ſpiritual love;</hi> not as you are Men, and have reaſonable Souls; but as new Men, who have my Image ſtampt on, and my holy Nature in you, and as you are <hi>made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by the comelineſs and beauty that I have put upon you,</hi> Ezek. 16.14. 2 Pet. 1.4. So do you love one another, with a holy ſpiritual love, namely, becauſe you are a lovely and a holy People unto me. (8) I love you with a <hi>conſtant and unchangable love,</hi> and that with a notwithſtanding all your weakneſſes, yea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes to, and unworthy walkings before me. Whom I once love with a ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar love, I <hi>continue to love for ever,</hi> Joh. 13.1.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53333:110"/>And I have engaged, that not any thing <hi>ſhall ſeparate you from me and my love,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi> Thus you are bound to love one another, even as I have loved, and ſhall alwayes love you. And as the Lord Jeſus commanded and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this by the word of his own mouth; So likewiſe by his Apoſtles. They do frequently and vehemently urge and preſs this Duty on Church-members every where, and back all their Commands (from Chriſt) with moſt ſtrong and cogent Arguments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8.9, 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2, 15, 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.7. Theſe are a few of the many places, where you may find this great Duty enjoyned on Believers and Church-Members; which they are indiſpenſibly bound to obſerve and obey. And therefore God <hi>ſheds this love into their hearts,</hi> and Teaches them to improve and uſe it, in loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. For he gives his People, and enables them to do that which he commands and requires of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the buſineſs of ſuch Stewards, is to uſe their Truſt well; and all lies on their diligence and faithfulneſs in Stewarding of it, <hi>as good Stewards of Gods Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! That Church-members, and all other Chriſtians would ſeriouſly, ſincerely, diligently and conſtantly mind and practiſe this great and indiſpenſible Duty to one another, in all their wayes and doings; and not lay it aſide as a little, uſeleſs or indifferent matter, which they may neglect, and diſpenſe with the omiſſion of, at their own will and pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53333:110"/>
               <p>Secondly, As we are indiſpenſibly bound to love one another, as you have heard; <hi>ſo we are as peremptorily, abſolutely and indiſpenſibly bound to walk lovely, and encouragingly towards one another:</hi> that by our unlovely and unworthy walkings, we lay not ſtumbling-blocks in the way of love, or diſcourage ſuch from loving us by our unlovely carriages, as do conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly aim at and endeavour ſo to love us, as Chriſt commands them to do. But that our Behaviours be ſuch in all things, as to invite all to love us, as holy, humble and blameleſs Saints and Brethren in Chriſt. Very many Profeſſors expect much love from their carnal and ſpiritual Relations, and are greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at them, if they fancy they are denyed it, and caſt the blame on them; whileſt they mind not, care not how unlovely and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragingly they walk and carry themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. But believe it; the Lord Jeſus expects, and he hath made it their Duty, to walk lovely towards one another, as well as to love one another. Church-members are bound to love one another, as holy, ſpiritual and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Objects; which they cannot do, unleſs they ſee, or have good grounds to believe them to be ſuch indeed. When they walk carnally, how can they love them as ſpiritual Heavenly perſons? and when they walk and carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves proudly, in their Words and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how can they love them as the meek and humble Members of Jeſus Chriſt? If their love muſt be holy and ſpiritual, then undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the Perſons or Objects of it muſt be ſuch alſo. For is it poſſible, or doth God require
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53333:111"/>me to love a Proud, Churliſh, Touchy, Peeviſh and Croſs-grained Profeſſor, as much, and with that complacency, I can or may love an humble, ſweet, meek and patient one? Can I, or is it my Duty ſo to love a ſowre, crabbed, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and quarrelling Relation, as a peaceable, quiet, affable and courteous one? Is it poſſible for me to love a vain, frothy, worldly Profeſſor, and one who cares not how unlovely, undeſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea, and in many things, how contrary he walks to me and my love; as I do, or may do another Profeſſor, who is Spiritual, Grave, Serious and Heavenly? ſurely! we cannot love perſons as holy, ſpiritual, humble, uſeful and Heavenly perſons are to be loved; unleſs they appear to be ſo in their words, deeds and carriages towards us; neither doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ought to be as careful of, and ſee that we walk lovely towards one another, as to love one another; that ſo we may as much as poſſible, provoke and encourage each other to love one another; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. and remove out of the way of love, all ſuch ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks, as may any way Impede or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it; that ſo we may encourage all to love us, really, ſtrongly, ſincerely, fervently, holily, ſpiritually and conſtantly: freely, eaſily, and that with delight and complacency For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as it will be moſt abſurd and irrational for us to expect it from them, ſo it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them ſo to love us. And by our own contrary walkings and carriages, we wrong our ſelves of their love to us, and tempt them to ſin againſt God, and injure their own
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53333:111"/>Souls. We ſhall grieve their hearts, and tempt them to withdraw their love and kindneſs from us, and thereby offend God, grieve and vex his holy Spirit, and by little and little to withdraw his loving Countenance from us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Chriſt hath charged and ſtrictly commanded all Church-members, to live in Peace: <hi>to be at Peace among themſelves, and to follow Peace with all men, and as much as in them is, to live peaceably with all men.</hi> Oh! how often, and with what vehemency, doth the Lord Jeſus and the Holy Ghoſt, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, preſs &amp; enjoyn this Duty, eſpecially, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Church-members, every where in the Goſpel? ſee ſome Texts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. And the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>God hath called us to Peace;</hi> not only to the Peace of God in our own Souls, and amity with him; but with one another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. ſuch walkings and carriages one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when in love and Obedience to God, are pleaſing to him; but <hi>ſtrife, diſcord and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch like practices, are moſt hateful and abominable to him,</hi> Pro. 6.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Theſe Six things doth the Lord hate, yea Seven are an abomination to him.</hi> And what is the Seventh? why, <hi>ſowing diſcord among Brethren.</hi> This wickedneſs is ſo hateful to God, as the words cannot ſufficiently declare his abhorrency of it. Hence we often find the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Paul</hi> earneſtly dehorting Church-members from all debates, ſtrifes, and contentions one with, or againſt another; eſpecially in their Church-meetings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53333:112"/>through ſtrife or vain glory, and</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Do all things without murmurings and diſputings,</hi> Rom. 13.13. And the word of God doth every where condemn it as a moſt accurſed Weed, and venomous Plant; a <hi>Cockatrice egg,</hi> and deviliſh Serpent. Pride is that Womb that bears it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.10. and the luſts of the heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. and the Devil is the Father and Authour of this accurſed ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.14, 15. Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> was much afflicted to ſee any of it in the Churches of Chriſt, as knowing from whence it ſprang, and what the fruit and end of it would be? what wrong it would do their Souls and what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it would lay them under? How it would reflect on Chriſt and his wayes, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them all contemptible? How it would hinder their profit, and produce many vile <hi>Monſters</hi> among them. As <hi>Envy, Wrath, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, evil ſurmiſings, Hatred, Back-bitings, Swellings, and Diviſions.</hi> And therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prevent the growth of them, and to pull up by the Roots, theſe pernitious Weeds: and that by Counſels, Reproofs, Cautions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and Dehortations from them; and preſſes them (and us) by all cogent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to avoid contention and ſtrife, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after Peace to the utmoſt of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> tells us, that it is a moſt <hi>pleaſant and lovely thing, for Brethren to dwell together in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Pſal. 133.1, 2. Then how much more pleaſant and lovely is it, for ſpiritual Brethren to live and worſhip God ſo together. Chriſt came into the World, and lived here a <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:53333:112"/>and charged all his followers to follow his ſteps; pronounces them <hi>bleſſed</hi> that do ſo, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.9. and <hi>accurſed</hi> who do the contrary. He is a lover of Peace and Concord, eſpecially in his holy Temples; where he will not have a <hi>Hammer</hi> heard: but he is an implacable hater of Strife and Diſcord, and will not endure it in them; much leſs will he <hi>winck at ſuch, as are the firſt ſowers of theſe Seeds.</hi> The truth is, ſtrivers and contenders in the Churches, are the Devils Agents, and notorious <hi>Miſchief-makers.</hi> They do a world of miſchief to a Church where they are, and are real Plagues to, or in it. They greatly hinder Edification, and ſpoil the Order, Beauty and Harmony there. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Diſputers in a Church, are the proud ſelf-conceited men, who are vainly puft up with high thoughts of themſelves, and their own abilities, and that becauſe they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſome light and notions into their heads, with a volubility of ſpeech, but without ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſdom and humility in their hearts: and therefore they conceit that they are wiſer than the Church, and more able to Manage and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church Affairs, than their Elders. Their Pride and ſelf-conceit makes them ſlight and contemn their Teachers, and to raiſe up in a Rebellious contention with, and oppoſition againſt them: As the Prophet complains, Hoſea. 4.4. <hi>For this people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi> They think nothing can be well done, unleſs they have the doing of it; and therefore when any good work is upon the Wheel, they will do all they can to hinder it, as ſome Churches can ſadly experience. Well
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53333:113"/>then, take heed of ſtrife and contention, and follow Peace and Concord one with another, eſpecially in your aſſembling together about Church-work. Get humble hearts, and then you will not be contentious, but peaceable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: <hi>Sympathize with, and help to bear each others burdens, as need requires.</hi> You are not to live to and for your ſelves, in a Church-State only; but to and for one another too. You are commanded to <hi>remember them that are in Bonds, as being bound with them,</hi> Heb. 13.3. <hi>and them that ſuffer Adverſity, as being your ſelves in the body.</hi> You are ſtrictly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and charged by the Great God, <hi>to rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep: and be of the ſame mind one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Rom. 12.15, 16. <hi>And look not every man at his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others,</hi> Phil 2.4. <hi>And let no man ſeek his own, but every man anothers Wealth,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Bear ye one anothers burden, and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</hi> You muſt make, and account your Brethrens Croſſes, Loſſes, Temptations and Afflictions, your own; and when they want and call for your helping hand, to ſupport or lift them up, being fallen, you muſt give it them freely, readily and chearfully, and not turn a deaf ear to, or hide your eyes from them and their cryes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this was one of Gods holy and Gracious ends in appointing Churches, and bringing you into Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and ſo into acquaintance one with another, namely, that you might be fellow-mutual-helpers and comforters one of another, For if you are cruel to, or careleſs of one
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53333:113"/>another in Affliction; the Lord Jeſus will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it at your hands, and take it as done to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſeeing it is the will of Chriſt, and our indiſpenſible Duty to one another; let us <hi>put on Bowels of Mercies and kindneſſes,</hi> Col. 3.12. <hi>and be tender hearted,</hi> Eph. 4. ult. And as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>be pitiful and courteous to each other,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8. Let the ſame mind be in us, and let us ſhew the ſame affection to one another (in meaſure) that Chriſt Jeſus hath ſhewed, and ſtill doth expreſs to us. We know that he is full of loving kindneſſes, pity, ſimpathy and bowels of mercy and compaſſion to us; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13, 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. to ſhew his Members, how they ſhould be, and carry themſelves towards one an other; and to oblige and provoke them to do ſo too. Oh! my Brethren: we ſhould much abound in this grace alſo.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: <hi>Exhort, and comfort one another.</hi> For ſo is the will of God concerning you. This is not only your Teachers Duty and Work, but yours alſo, to each other, Heb. 10.24, 25. <hi>And let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works; but exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This Work and Duty muſt be diligently and frequently done, Heb. 3.13. <hi>But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves together, and edifie one another, even as alſo ye do,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Now we beſeech you Brethren, warn them that are unruly; comfort the feeble minded, ſupport the weak.</hi> My Brothren you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53333:114"/>ſtand in continual need of one anothers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Conſolations; and if you mind and manage this work well, you may be very uſeful and profitable one to another, greatly oblige and knit your hearts to each other, and occaſion many thankſgivings unto God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. We are exceeding apt and prone to fall backward, and therefore need each others hand to draw us forward. To grow cold and dead hearted; and therefore need each others help to warm and quicken us. We are apt and ready to ſtand ſtill, and lye down a <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;</hi> and therefore do greatly need one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers awakenings and holy provocations. When this duty was frequently and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly practiſed by the Saints, they did thrive and proſper: but ſince it hath been ſo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected, the contrary is apparent in the lives and carriages of the Saints. Well then; do you revive this work all you can. Set it forward with all your might, and improve all your opportunities to the profit of each others Souls: for you ſee that it is your indiſpenſible Duty.</p>
               <p>Sixthly: <hi>It is the will of your Head, the Lord Jeſus, that you ſhould be each others Keepers.</hi> That you ſhould <hi>watch</hi> one over another; <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and Reprove</hi> one another, as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. I do not mean, that you ſhould prye into one anothers ſecrets, or be <hi>buſie-bodies in other mens matters.</hi> No, for that is hateful and abominable; and God hath forbidden you to do ſo, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. But my meaning is this, namely, that you watch over one anothers Walkings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53333:114"/>That if they do well, you may encourage them. If ill, you may by Counſel, Reproofs, Admonitions, Inſtructions, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, labour to mend them: and do all you can, to convince and bring them to the real ſight and ſenſe of their miſcarriages, as alſo to unfeigned Repentance. By which good work, you will do them, the Church, yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, good and acceptable ſervice. You ſhould carefully mind and obſerve, <hi>if all do keep cloſe to their Duty in the Church,</hi> or are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and negligent. If they carry themſelves holily, righteouſly and ſoberly in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: or on the contrary, they are frothy, vain, proud, extravagant, looſe, unjuſt, idle, careleſs, or any way ſcandalous. You ſhould ſtrictly mind and obſerve, if there be any <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Back-biters, or ſowers of Diſcord,</hi> or ſuch as ſpeak contemptibly and ſlightingly of their Brethren, eſpecially of their Elders, and their Adminiſtrations. As alſo, <hi>ſuch as combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and make parties or factions in the Church; or endeavour to load or obſtruct any good work,</hi> which their Elders are promoting of, for the Glory of Chriſt and the good of the Church; and deal with them accordingly. You muſt mind and carefully obſerve, if any be fallen under Sin or Temptation, in any caſe, and not let them alone, but preſently ſet your hand to help them, to ſuccour and reſtore them; Gal. 6.1. <hi>Brethren; if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one with the Spirit of meekneſs; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be Tempted.</hi> Take heed of that <hi>Cain like Spirit;</hi> who when God
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53333:115"/>asked him where his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> was? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, <hi>am I my Brothers keeper,</hi> Gen. 4. You will be Tempted to this evil towards your Brethren, namely, to imagine that you are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing concerned with them, and that if they do otherwiſe than they ſhould, the guilt will only lie at their doors; but you ſhall be blameleſs. But my Brethren, it is not ſo. You are not to be indifferent in this matter. For aſſuredly, you are appointed to be keepers of one another. You are bound to prevent and put a ſtop to ſin in one another: or elſe your Brethrens ſins, which you do, or may know if you will, and the wrong they do to themſelves thereby; yea and the Reproach and ſcandal that may come to the Church thereby, will lie at your Doors, and be caſt on your Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you neglected your Duty, and did not in ſeaſon prevent it, as you might have done; if you would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but on the things of others alſo,</hi> Phil. 2.4. <hi>And ſeek not your own, but every one anothers Wealth,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Now we exhort you Brethren; warn the unruly,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. <hi>and Admoniſh the diſorderly,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.15. For this good work, and their wiſe &amp; conſcientious doing of it, the Holy Ghoſt commends the Church at <hi>Rome, Chap.</hi> 15.14. And ſayes God in Levit. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him, and not ſuffer ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi> And the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us to take heed, <hi>that we be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of other mens ſins,</hi> but to <hi>keep our ſelves pure in</hi> Math. 18.15, 16, 17. The Lord preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53333:115"/>this Duty and VVork on you, and ſhews you how you ſhould perform it. Therefore, you muſt mind and carefully do it, in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, and according to your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, and not otherwiſe. You muſt watch, and endeavour to gain a Sinner, or ſinning Member; by your firſt, private Admonition, in caſe the evil be private: and if that will not do, take one or two more with thee, and ſee what that will do. But if that will not do the work, nor obtain the end on thy Brothers Soul, then you are bound to bring it to the Church; that by their Teachers or Elders, they may be informed of it, in order to their dealing with, and proceedings againſt him, as commanded. This is another of your great and indiſpenſible VVorks and Duties in the Church. It is true, that this is eſpecially the Elders VVork and Duty, but it is not theirs only, but yours alſo, who are private Members. Oh! therefore, be you perſwaded to mind; carefully, faithfully and diligently to practiſe this VVork and Duty; for unleſs you do ſo, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep the Church in Peace, Honour and Purity. You will do Chriſt and them ſingular ſervice.</p>
               <p>Seventhly: <hi>You muſt forbear and forgive one another:</hi> for this is another of your comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Duties, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2. <hi>forbearing one another in love,</hi> verſ. 32. <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted: forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> And in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another: if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do yee.</hi> Doth
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53333:116"/>thy Brother ſin againſt thee, or do thee any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury? thou ſhouldſt tell him of it, examine the matter and ſearch out the circumſtances of it; and ſee if he did it unadviſedly, through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ignorance, and without any deſign to wrong thee, or whether he did it wittingly, and knowingly? And until thou art ſure that he did it knowingly and wittingly, or wilfully, thou muſt forbear cenſuring him, as having ſo done it. For elſe thou wilt prove a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and a falſe Judge;</hi> which Chriſt forbids, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. But if upon an impartial ſearch, thou finds him to have wronged thee through ignorance or weakneſs, thou muſt Judge charitably of him, and carry thy ſelf towards him, as God doth towards thee under thy weakneſſes and ignorances. Thou muſt not be raſh and ſevere towards him, either in thy carriages or cenſures. But if it clearly appear upon impartial enquiry, that he did knowingly and wilfully do thee wrong; then thou muſt carry thy ſelf towards, and deal with him, as with a wilful Tranſgreſſor. Thou muſt lay his ſin before him, and ſhew him what Lawes he hath Tranſgreſſed; what evil he hath done thee, what wrong to his own Soul, and what offence he hath done to Chriſt, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy Laws. <hi>Admoniſh</hi> him again and again of his ſin, and cenſure him not too ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, until you find him obſtinate and ſtubborn. For until then, you muſt forbear him; whileſt you are waiting on him, and on God for him, to convince him of his ſin, and give him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life. But if your endeavours be bleſſed to thoſe ends, you muſt readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53333:116"/>him. And if he be once truly, and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of and humbled for his ſin: be ſure, that he will moſt freely own and confeſs it to thee, as well as to God, and endeavour to make thee amends, and give thee all poſſible ſatisfaction for the wrong he hath done thee. And this he will do, not by conſtraint, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly, and of his own accord, without thy ſeeking to him. For it is a certain ſign that a perſon is not powerfully and ſavingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of, and humbled for his ſin, while he hangs off, and muſt be ſought after to make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſuch as he hath wronged. For were his heart really melted into the will of God, he durſt not, yea could not be quiet, until he hath given all poſſible ſatisfaction to the wronged, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. But now in caſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main obſtinate, and will not hearken to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: what are you to do then? why, then he ſhould take one or two more, and deal with him; and if that will not do, to bring it to the Church; that they, by their Elders, may ſee what they can do with him. But if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail on him to repent and make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: then I think the offended may proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law againſt him. <hi>For the Law is made for the lawleſs and diſobedient,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9, 10. But yet he ſhould be ſtill in a readineſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him when-ever he ſhall repent; pray and hope that he may repent, and when he doth ſo (although it be long firſt) Actually and Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forgive him, and renew his kindneſs and Brotherly love to him, as if he had never ſinned.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:53333:117"/>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>It is your Indiſpenſible duty, to hearken too, and receive Inſtruction, Admonition and Reproofs one from another alſo.</hi> For if ſome are Indiſpenſibly bound, at ſome times, to give them: Surely; others who need them, are as much bound to receive them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.33. <hi>hear Inſtruction and be wiſe. For he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Reproof, ſinneth, but he that keepeth Inſtruction, walketh in the way of Life, Prov.</hi> 10.17. And the Scripture tells us in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Whoſo loveth Inſtruction, loveth knowledge: but he that hateth Reproof is bruitiſh,</hi> ſuch as turn a deaf Ear to Reproofs, are marked out for <hi>Scorners</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. <hi>and he that is often reproved, and yet hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that without remedy, Prov.</hi> 29.1. ſuch as turn a deaf Ear to Reproofs and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſlight and refuſe them, do thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt, trample upon, and contemn an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and a means of his appointing, for their happineſſe, and ſo they murder their own Souls, with the means that are given to ſave them. You are bound to hearken to, and receive, your brethrens Reproofs, Counſels and Admonitions; withall Humility Patience and freedome of Spirit: with all love, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Thanfulneſſe to God, and the givers of them. For they are great mercies to you, and they are your real and profitable friends; ſuch as ſeek your good, and endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your deſtruction. And therefore, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at the Scriptures ſaying, that ſuch as refuſe Inſtruction and Reproof, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed; and that without remedy: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do deſpiſe the means (as in their preſent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53333:117"/>caſe) of their Salvation, and which are handled out to them, to prevent their deſtruction. And certainly they <hi>ſhall have Judgment without mercy,</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) who do ſlight the means given them, for ſuch great Ends, and by hardening their hearts againſt them, do render them uſeleſſe to their Souls, and thereby op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and croſſe Gods ends.</p>
               <p>Oh! then, do not you ſo wickedly. When a Brother or Siſter, ſee or hear you ſin, and they come to you with the Lords healing play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to cure you, receive it; thank them, and bleſſe God for it; apply and improve it, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Abigals</hi> and <hi>Nathans</hi> Counſels and Reproofs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and ſee that you repent and humble your ſelves in Duſt and Aſhes. For if the contrary heart and carriage be found in you, under juſt Reproofs, Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Admonitions, toward God or men: know for a certainty, that you are in a very evil and dangerous caſe; yea you are in the high way to ruine and perdition. Oh! Friends, let it never be ſaid juſtly, of any of you, that you were reproved and admoniſhed of any known Sins, by any Brother or Siſter; and that you refuſed, and ſlighted it; juſtified your ſelves in your Sins and apparent Tranſgreſſions, and were diſpleaſed with, or angry at ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed you, and did their Indiſpenſible duty to you, under your Sin, for your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Ninthly. <hi>Pray one for another,</hi> and that with a real Love, fervency, and Importunity, as you do, or ſhould do for your ſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſſe your faults one to another, and pray one
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53333:118"/>for another, that ye may be healed.</hi> Oh! with what ſerious minds and ſtrong Affections, ſhould all Church-members, pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They muſt be much <hi>in building up</hi> one another, <hi>and praying in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> one for another, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. They ſhould carry one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on their hearts, <hi>at the Throne of Grace,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are under Affliction: the whole Church in General, and the <hi>Teachers in particular, Heb.</hi> 13.18. and wreſtle with God for them. For (as was ſhewed) one Church-member muſt make anothers caſe his own, and be of a publique Spirit towards, and for the good of all: and as in other things ſo in this of Prayer. For they have the Spirit of Prayer given them, Audience and Intereſt in Heaven for others, as well as for themſelves. This is another duty to one another.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>You ſhould often meet together for holy diſcourſe and Prayer.</hi> Two or three, or more; Brethren by themſelves, and Siſters by themſelves, in and for thoſe God glorifying, and Soul-profiting exerciſes. This was wont to be the Commendable practiſe of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and of ſome that are now alive, when Chriſt, Duty, Heaven and Religion lay war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer on their hearts, than now they do. And they made <hi>happy earnings</hi> of their holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Now if it was a much commended Practiſe in them as it was; why then is not the ſame found in and among you, in this day? was it good in them, and will it not be ſo in you too? hath not God promiſed his Glorious Teaching, warming, ſtrengthning, ſanctifying, and comforting preſence with ſuch as do ſo?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53333:118"/>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. would not your meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo exerciſing your ſelves, turn to a better account, than your preſent practiſe doth? do you not find time enough, to viſit one another, and meet together, to diſcourſe and talk of things which you ſhould not? Do you not viſit to tell ſome idle ſtories, to tattle of other mens matters, which do not concern you; and it may be, to do that which is worſer; namely, to Back-bite ſome perſons, and to prejudice hearts againſt your Teachers and their Work, if they do not pleaſe you? And will not ſuch meetings have bitterneſs in the end? Yea, do you not thereby, exceedingly deaden &amp; carnalize each others Souls, by theſe things? So that inſtead of bettering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Souls, and furthering them towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in your meetings, you hinder them, and make them much worſer. Oh! conſider, and lay this matter to heart, I do beſeech you: now while you have time to mend what is amiſs. Conſider my friends both how you do, and how you may and ought to improve and exerciſe your ſelves, in your occaſional and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned viſits and meetings; and what account you will be able to give of them at the laſt day. Is it not your great Iniquity to tempt one another to Sin, and wrong your Souls, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend your pretious times and ſeaſons of ſervice for God, and one anothers ſpiritual profit? when you might if you would, have improved them to thoſe ends. We read in Acts 16.13. <hi>That Women meet together to pray:</hi> but now 'tis accounted almoſt a falſe Doctrine. Men and Women were wont to diſcourſe and ſpeak
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53333:119"/>often of the things of God, and their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, one to another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. But where are now any ſuch (almoſt) to be found? perſons can find time enough for every thing, but their greateſt VVorks and Duties. But to ſpeak plainly; 'tis not our want of time, but of hearts. VVe are ſtrangers to God in ſecret, looſe our hearts in the VVorld, and cloy our ſelves with carnal cares and earthly matters: and therefore cannot, will not attend with any delight or freedom of Spirit unto our Duties. This will be found at the bottom of all our neglects, and excuſes for them. But remember, that your Souls need this practiſe, and the uſe of theſe means, that it is your Duty, and will be (if well uſed) very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly: <hi>Encourage one another by your examples, to keep cloſe to, and be conſtant in your publick work.</hi> VVhen ever the Church meets, or are by their Teacher Summoned to meet together, for the Celebration of the worſhip of God: they are bound ſo to do (excepting in extraordinary caſes) that may hinder any. For elſe there can be nothing done, nor any good order kept, for the glory of God, and the edification of the Church. Now then, when the Church ought to meet together, you ought to be preſent, and not by your wilful or careleſs abſence give an evil example to others, and tempt them to do the like. For thereby you will caſt a ſtumbling-block in their way of Duty, and encourage, ſtrengthen and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden them in their neglects alſo. If it be our Duty to provoke one another to good
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53333:119"/>works, by our Exhortations, then alſo by our Examples and practiſes too. <hi>Examples</hi> are powerful encouragements to Sin or Duty, to good or evil; to Omiſſions or Commiſſions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3, 9. If they are good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then they provoke others to good, but if evil, then they are powerful to provoke others to do the ſame. VVhen a Member is in the Congregation, and ſees ſuch a Member wanting there, then he is tempted to take the ſame ſinful liberty too: and ſo in all other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. All Church-members are indiſpenſibly bound, ordinarily to attend on the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in that Church to which they are joyned. For as they are there called and ſet, ſo their work and Duty lies there. <hi>Not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Aſſembling of your ſelves together,</hi> Heb. 10.25. and becauſe ſome are not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo to do; therefore (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>do you provoke each other, to your Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelfthly: <hi>You muſt be charitable to the poor, that are among you, and freely contribute to them, according to your Ability, and their Neceſſity.</hi> You are indiſpenſibly bound to impart your help and aſſiſtance to them, and give them a little of your Eſtates. As you are <hi>Stewards</hi> for your ſelves, ſo alſo for them. It is a Debt you owe to God, and a Duty to them: you will comfort them thereby, but you will much more profit your ſelves, than you can poſſibly profit them. <hi>It is a more bleſſed thing to give, than to receive,</hi> Acts 20.35. It is your honour and happineſs, that God enables you to give to them, but it is their Affliction, that they are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53333:120"/>neceſſitated to receive from you. You ſtand on the Advantage ground by them, both as to work and wages. And therefore, thou has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to deſpiſe them, or grudge at thy diſtributions to them. Thou art their <hi>Steward,</hi> and a part of what God hath given thee, was deſigned and intended for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. And therefore (ſayes God) Deut. 15.7, 12. <hi>I command thee to open thy hand wide unto thy Brother, that is waxen poor by thee.</hi> (Read the words at large) obſerve likewiſe theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diligently mark and conſider them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 9. Chapters. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1, 2, 3. You muſt not only give, to keep them alive in miſery, but make comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proviſions for them; that they may have enough to keep them from the Temptations of Poverty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> preſſing wants, and to enable and encourage them for, and in their work and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to God and men.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly: <hi>You muſt carefully, watchfully, diligently, and conſcientiouſly beware of, and avoid whatever may give any juſt offence or ſcandal to one another.</hi> For we are charged, <hi>to give none offence, either to Jew or Gentile, or to the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. And ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>take heed, leſt by any means this liberty of yours become a ſtumbling-block,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. And our Saviour tells us, <hi>that woe to them by whom the offence comes,</hi> Math. 18.7. and charges his Diſciples, to take heed and beware of giving any offence to his little ones, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>You muſt not only mind that which you ought to do, but that which you muſt alſo leave
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53333:120"/>undone. For although you ſhould ſtrive to do never ſo much good, yet if that while you are not careful of eſchewing evil, you will do a great deal of hurt, and pull down with the one hand, that which you ſeem to build up with the other. And you muſt alſo ſee, that you do one Duty as well as another. For although you may be frequent attenders on the Ordinances of God in the Church, yet if you come not timely to them, or carry your ſelves unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in them, you will give juſt offence. So if you ſhould be charitable to the poor, and yet be negligent in publick worſhip, you will give offence.</p>
               <p>But to be brief: know, that you muſt take heed and beware of ſuch evils as theſe, and avoid them. For they do all of them carry a Brand in their fore-heads, and ſcandalous miſchiefs in their hands, both to your own and others Souls. And therefore you ſhould mind them, endeavour to know and avoid them, that they be not found in you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As 1. Proud, lofty ſwelling, diſdainful and haughty words, carriages, walkings and deportments: For they are grievous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking evils, and ſuch as will juſtly offend all the obſervers of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt avoid all ſullen, ſowre and churliſh Language and Behaviour towards all ſorts of perſons, or elſe you will offend them: For it is an evil that is altogether unbecoming the Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt beware of a croſs, captious, and contradicting Spirit, and carriage: There are too to many ſuch Members in Churches;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53333:121"/>whoſe peculiar Excellency, or rather vileneſs lies in this; and who delight in a ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of mind and diſcourſe againſt the work, ſenſe, propoſals and judgment of the Church, and the Elders thereof. That ſo they may be heard, and may hear themſelves talk, and from the Pride and haughtineſs of their Spirits, they may ſeem ſome bodies in the Church, or in other Company. But this is very ſcandalous to their Brethren, (excepting ſuch as they have made of their Faction to joyn with them in their unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and very reproachful to themſelves; as they will find at long run; But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You muſt beware of, &amp; avoid, peeviſh, froward and touchy carriages, words and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, in private and publick. For they are very ſcandalous and offenſive.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt not withdraw your ſelves from your place, work, and Duty in the Church, nor abſent from the VVorſhip and Ordinances of God there, in their times and ſeaſons. For that is a moſt ſcandalous and pernitious evil, as you heard before. It hath an innumerable Company of evils in the Womb of it, and that do attend it: which I have now no room to mention. And it is a direct Tranſgreſſion of Gods Laws, Rules and Orders in his Churches, beſides the ſcandal and evil conſequences of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of that filthy ſin, of ſpeaking evil of one another behind their backs; you muſt not be Whiſperers or Back-biters, nor ſpeak of the real or ſuppoſed evils of one another, but to their faces, or before them;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53333:121"/>until you have done your duty to them in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. For if you ſhould, you will greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, and greatly ſtumble, offend and ſcandalize ſuch, as you ſo ſpeak evil of.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You muſt beware of ſpeaking ſlightingly and contemptibly of one another, either to their faces, or behind their backs. For men, yea the beſt of men, will not, cannot patiently bear contemptuous words, and undeſerved ſlighting carriages from their Brethren.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You muſt beware of and avoid vain, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and frothy diſcourſes; for they are very ſcandalous and offenſive to gracious hearts.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Take heed of Earthly-mindedneſs, and greedy purſuits after worldly things; for as they are offenſive to God and pernitious to your own Souls: ſo they are ſcandalous and grievous to beholders.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Take heed and beware of ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongſt your ſelves; for that will do a world of miſchief, and produce many evil and wicked fruits.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Take heed of grudging at, or envying one anothers proſperity; for thereby you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul God himſelf, and give occaſion of great offence to your Brethren; when they ſhall ſee, that they cannot receive mercies from God, without your envyings and grudgings.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Be ſure to deal juſtly with all men, and give to every one his due: defrauding is a very reproachful and ſcandalous ſin. Contract not Debts, and delay, or deny to pay them; For if you do, you will ſcandalize your Brethren, and cauſe the name of God to be evil ſpoken of.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53333:122"/>
               <p n="13">13. Be ſure to make good, and perform all your peremptory promiſes to men, and take heed and beware of breaking them, or fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and diſappointing men of their juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from you; for that alſo will be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and offenſive.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Take heed of taking into a marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, ſuch as are apparently in an unbelieving and carnal ſtate and condition; For that alſo is very offenſive to holy ſerious men: although ſome make light of it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Take heed of idleneſs and ſlothfulneſs in your Callings; For that will prove a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſcandalous ſin to others, and your own ſouls too.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Take not up a Report againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is ſcandalous, nor give an ear unto Tatlers and buſie-bodies, nor be you buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in other mens matters your ſelves; For if you do, you will give great offence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome, and but ſome of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous evils that you muſt carefully avoid, as a duty that you owe to God, to your Brethren and to your own ſouls. I could have named many more, but I find theſe the moſt common amongſt Profeſſors.</p>
               <p>Now as you muſt avoid theſe and other evils; mind and practiſe the ſaid Duties, as Church-Members one to another: ſo you muſt ſeriouſly mind the <hi>manner, reaſons</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of doing them alſo. The reaſon of your ſo doing, muſt be the will of Chriſt your Head and King, becauſe he hath ſo commanded you. And the <hi>principle</hi> of all you do, muſt be love to him, and to the ſouls of your Brethren. The <hi>ends</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:53333:122"/>muſt be to pleaſe, honour and exalt the Lord Jeſus, and to profit and benefit your Brethrens ſouls, and maintain the Credit and Reputation of the Church, and the Worſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God therein; and to preſerve Peace and Purity among your ſelves. The <hi>manner</hi> muſt be thus; namely, wiſely, dutifully, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, obediently, freely, willingly, humbly, holily, ſeriouſly, diligently, ſincerely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly. For you ſhould be as careful of doing your Duties to men in a right manner, as you are of performing your Duties imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to God ſo. I can but mention theſe things, becauſe I have exceeded my intentions in others. The Lord God bleſs them to you all.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble Duty, as hath been already ſhewed. Believers may not enter
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53333:123"/>their names among Chriſt's Diſciples, and then take liberty to do what they pleaſe; omit or neglect their place and duty there, when, and how they will, and content themſelves with having their names enrolled in a Church; come among them, and go from them at their own will and pleaſure. No, but it is the will and Ordinance of our Lord Jeſus, that they ſhould conſtantly, and conſcientiouſly in obedience to his holy will, abide and continue there, holding Communion or Fellowſhip together, as a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and entire body, or ſpiritual Corporation, and joyntly with one mind, heart and ſoul, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and celebrate his Ordinances and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 44, 46, 47. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Preaching and hearing the Goſpel.</hi> It is true, that this is not a ſpecial Church-Ordinance, or an Ordinance appointed for and given to Churches, or to Believers, excluſive of all others. For it is the great Ordinance of God for the converting, quickning, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners to Chriſt, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. By this Ordinance God conveys his ſpecial Grace, and the ſpirit of Grace into ſinners hearts. By it he <hi>opens blind eyes, unſtops deaf cars, enlivens dead Souls,</hi> and <hi>convinces carnal men of ſin, Righteouſneſs and Judgments;</hi> Acts 26.18. Joh. 5.25. Joh. 16.7, 8. And by it <hi>he turns them from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> and works them to, and for his own uſe; makes them <hi>Veſſels of Honour,</hi> and <hi>tranſlates them out of the Kingdom of darkneſs</hi> and the Devil <hi>into his own Kingdom,</hi> Col. 1.13. The great Ordinance of Preaching and hearing the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53333:123"/>Law and Goſpel, is given and appointed to make, fit and prepare ſinful men for Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, &amp; his holy Goſpel-Churches. For until they are moulded and qualified by the word and ſpirit, they are no way capable of either, conſidering what condition all men are in by ſinful nature; namely, <hi>dead, blind, filthy, vile, hateful, enemies to God, Children of Satan, under the Law, the curſe and wrath of God, ſtrangers to and ignorant of God, Chriſt, Grace, Duty and Goſpel-holineſs.</hi> But although hearing and preaching the word of God, be an Ordinance of God to others, namely, ſuch as are not en-Churched, to prepare them for that State, and the Duties and Priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yet I think it may be called a Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance alſo. For the Lord Jeſus hath by his ſoveraign Authority ſet this Ordinance in his Goſpel-Churches, and committed the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it unto men there, namely, to ſuch as he is ſaid to impower and ſend, to give unto, and ſet among them for the work of the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. The Miniſtry of their Paſtors and Teachers is their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and theſe Officers being given to them by Chriſt, and ſet in his Churches for their ſakes, they may call the Ordinance their Ordinance, ſuch Officers theirs, and their Miniſtry theirs, as having a peculiar Relation to them; which is one of the Churches peculiar priviledges, and which they ought highly to prize, and bleſs God for. Now as ſome men are gifted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and ſent out by Chriſt, to convert and turn men to Chriſt, who may not have any
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53333:124"/>Relation to Churches, as their Paſtors or Teachers, ſo there is the ſpecial and peculiar Miniſtry of Paſtors and Teachers given to, and ſet in the Churches; whoſe work and buſineſs lyes there, and but occaſionally elſe-where to other men. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>to the Flock, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God,</hi> Act. 20.28. The ends of theſe Officers, and their Miniſtry in the Church, is not intended for the calling and regenerating of Church-Members; for (as was ſhewed) they muſt be effectually called and regenerated, before they can be meet Members of a Holy Temple of God: but to build up and carry on the work of Grace in their hearts, holineſs and fruitfulneſs in their lives and walkings towards God and men; To confirm and eſtabliſh them in the Truth and Faith of Chriſt, which they have received, and to inſtruct and enlighten them further in all Chriſt's and their own ſouls concernments. This Ordinance of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and deſigned by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>and it ſhould be ſo uſed and managed by all Teachers and Hearers continually,</hi> to carry on the work of Grace, to convey and receive more of the <hi>Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, and ſhew them more clearly the evil of ſin, the deceits of their hearts, the power of in-dwelling luſts, the Wiles and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Satan, the neceſſity of Chriſt and his blood, and of his Ordinances and Inſtitutions; To ſhew and convince them of the Excellency, Beauty and Lovelineſs of Chriſt, and the love and grace of God to them in him; To Preach
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53333:124"/>and hear their hearts and ſouls into clearer knowledge of the three perſons and one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal living God, and into more acquaintance with them; ſo likewiſe into more cordial and unfeigned, more ſtrong and fervent, pure and conſtant love to him; To acquaint themſelves with the nature, uſefulneſs and proper life of faith, perſwade and work their hearts to it, practically and dutifully to love it in all things, works, duties and conditions; To arm and ſence them againſt Satans fiery Darts, and Temptations, and the worlds ſnares and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; To diſcover and detect ſelf luſts, and whatever warrs againſt our ſouls, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and deſtroy them; and in order thereunto, to know and be able, expert and accurate in the uſe of our ſpiritual Weapons and Armour of proof, which Chriſt hath ſanctified and given unto us; in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. and elſewhere in the Goſpel; <hi>To ſanctifie them throughout in ſoul, body and ſpirit,</hi> keep them from deadneſs, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lukewarmneſs, and indifferency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to prevent ſleepineſs and back-ſliding from God, neglect of duties, and careleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. This Ordinance is intended for the further informing them of the holy will and mind of Chriſt, and their duties to God and men, to ſweeten and diſpoſe the heart to love and practice them, and to enable them to perſiſt in ſo doing without wearineſs and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grudging or diſputing, and with joy and delight; To call back perſons from their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, and to give them Repentance unto life. Theſe are ſome of Gods holy and bleſſed ends in ſetting up this Ordinance in the Church:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53333:125"/>which all are indiſpenſibly bound to aim at, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and endeavour in all their uſe of it. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12, 17. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Micah.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17, 19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prayer,</hi> Prayer to God is a Church-Ordinance. It is true, that all men are bound to pray to God both publickly and privately: the neglect whereof is ſeverely threatned; <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> It is a part of natural or moral Worſhip, which all men ought to practiſe continually. For as God is their Creator, and they his reaſonable Creatures, he their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and they his Subjects, and as ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are to live, and alwayes to have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency on him for their ſubſiſtence in this world: ſo they are to expreſs and manifeſt their ſo doing, by their asking ſuch things as they want of him. For it is a Duty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they owe him, as him in <hi>whom they live, move and have their being,</hi> Acts 17.28. and profeſs him to be their God, Protector and maintainer, and expect all things from him. They ought <hi>in all their wayes to acknowledge him,</hi> Prov. 3.6. although they know him not in the face of Chriſt by any Goſpel-Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But notwithſtanding this is a Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance alſo, that is, they are appointed to pray publickly in their meetings, as a Church, and that not as it is a moral Duty, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reaſon, and mens natural principle, but as it is a Goſpel-Ordinance of Chriſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, and they commanded by him to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53333:125"/>obſerve it among themſelves. This the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was commended for, Act. 2.42. <hi>And they continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church unto God.</hi> Now this Ordinance in the Churches of Chriſt muſt be obſerved and practiſed, as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his appointing, who is Lord and Head of them, and becauſe it is his Sovereign will they ſhould ſo do, without which they cannot in the doing of it, approve themſelves unto him, as his obedient Children and Subjects in his houſe. For whatever work they do, and whatever Ordinance they obſerve in the Church, they are indiſpenſibly bound to reſpect his will, and have their eye on his Authority therein, as the ground and reaſon of what they do; and becauſe he hath ſo commanded and appointed, therefore they do it. Moreover to the well performance of this Duty, and right obſervance of this Ordinance in the Church, there is required a peculiar Miniſterial gift in the Teachers or Overſeers of the Church. For they cannot rightly perform this part of their work in and for the Church, by their natural and common acquired gifts and parts, but in and by the ſpirit and his Miniſterial gifts and grace conferred on them, for their profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and right performance of their Works and Duties in the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6, 7, 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> water-Baptiſm is another Church-Ordinance, to be holily, reverendly, dutifully and ſpiritually obſerved. The
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53333:126"/>power of adminiſtring this holy Ordinance of Chriſt is given to <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> and only to ſuch as are authorized and called to adminiſter other Ordinances, and perform o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the work of the Miniſtry, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, by virtue of their Commiſſion from Chriſt received: Any Diſciple of Chriſt may not adminiſter it, but ſuch as are ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> part for, and appointed to the work. For they muſt do it, and it muſt alwayes be done by men in office-power, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>That Chriſt gave ſome Paſtors and Teachers for the work of the Miniſtry, and edifying of the body of Chriſt:</hi> And we never read in Scripture of any other, than ſuch as were called to the work of the Miniſtry, that did Baptize any. This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is inſtituted and appointed in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. and it was confirmed by the conſtant practice of the Apoſtles and Teachers after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47, 48. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Baptiſm is a Sign, Token and Seal of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant, (as Circumciſion was <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.) for the aſſuring and confirming Believers of the reality of the Covenant, and the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes of God to perform it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey unto them all the Grace and bleſſings of it in his time. To raiſe and ſtrengthen their hope in Chriſt and God the Father by him, that God is and will be their God, and alſo the God of their Seed, according to that glorious grant and engagement of God, in Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53333:126"/>thy Seed after thee.</hi> To which Covenant, God ſet his Seal, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. This general ſum or head of the Covenant given to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, we have produced and brought in by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Sermon after the coming of the Holy Ghoſt on him and other of the Apoſtles, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. when he was about the ſetting up of Churches and Church-Order, Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances among them (ſayes he) <hi>Repent yee and be Baptized;</hi> why? <hi>for the promiſe is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call:</hi> which is the ſame for ſubſtance given before to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Galatians</hi> Chapt. 3.14. <hi>That the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>is come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, is of meer Inſtitution, and made known to us in and by the Goſpel. The Light and Law of nature knows nothing of it; neither are we bound to obſerve it, but upon the command and appointment of Chriſt, which is ſufficient for us, and we need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warrant for our obſervation of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Lords Supper</hi> is clearly another Church-Ordinance. And indeed it cannot be rightly and orderly adminiſtred and received, but in a regular Church-ſtate; we never read of any Believers that received it, or any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that adminiſtred it, after Chriſt's aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as they were congregated, en-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, em-bodied and formed into a holy Temple: but we read of Churches celebrating it; as at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 11. and elſewhere. We find the Inſtitution of this
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53333:127"/>Ordinance in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.22, 23, 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.17, 18, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. to the end. In this laſt Scripture we have many weighty things of and concerning this great Ordinance (1) The Inſtitution its ſelf. (2) The time when, the ſame night in the which he was betrayed. (3) The Inſtitutor, namely, the Lord Jeſus. (4) The manner of it: 1. The Lord Jeſus's own practiſe, <hi>He took, bleſſed, brake and gave the Bread, and ſaid, take, eat, this is my Body.</hi> 2. By commandment, <hi>this do ye in remembrance of me.</hi> (5) Who ſhould received it, and how perſons ſhould be qualified and prepared for the reception of it. 1. With light and faith: They muſt be able to <hi>diſcern the Lords body,</hi> the ends and uſe of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to make ſuitable and pertinent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all to themſelves. 2. They muſt be able to <hi>examine themſelves,</hi> and actually to do it, and be in a ſtate and practical fitneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to meet Chriſt in it, to thank and praiſe him, and to <hi>ſhew forth his death until he come.</hi> (6) The danger and peril they are in who eat, and drink, and uſe this holy Ordinance unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. 1. They are <hi>guilty of his Body and Blood.</hi> 2. <hi>Of their own damnation.</hi> (7) We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ſome of the ſad effects their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving of this holy Ordinance had on ſome of them: <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Singing of Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> is another Church-Ordinance or Inſtitution of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.26. This is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ordinance and Duty; yea it is a heart-warming,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53333:127"/>Soul-refreſhing, Spirit-raiſing, and grace-quickning. Ordinance. To the well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, much ſpecial grace and diligent exerciſe of it, as alſo the ſpirit of grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Much wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life and vigor, care and watchfulneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; ſincerity and faithfulneſs, ſpirituality and heavenly-mindedneſs is needful for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable obſervance of it to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. It is true, that all men ought to ſing praiſes and thankſgivings unto God, for it is a natural and moral duty: and it is as true, that none can rightly, holily and acceptably do it, but ſuch as are partakers of the grace and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; and that the Lord Jeſus hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it, and made it a Church-Ordinance. And as, or becauſe he hath inſtituted, and made it one of his Goſpel-Ordinances for his Churches, that therefore they ought ſo to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
               <p>Sevently: <hi>Holy diſcourſes and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among the members of the Church,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church Ordinance, which all are bound to mind and practiſe, as they have ability and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: for the obſervation and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which, they ſhould ſeek for occaſions and ſeaſons to meet together, and endeavour to promote it: and when they have them in their hands, to uſe and improve them to the glory of God, and their own mutual profit; and that becauſe it is their Lords Ordinance for their good: The neglect of which is (doubtleſs) one of the procuring cauſes of thoſe withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, languiſhings, and moſt dreadful decays in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53333:128"/>grace, and woful back-ſlidings, which are ſo notoriouſly evident among Church-members. This uſeful profitable Ordinance, was once in eſteem &amp; much accounted of by Believers; but it is now almoſt laid aſide &amp; forgotten by them; it was their delight, but now their burden. They made happy earnings of it to their Souls, but now they fancy that they have no need of it, that there is neither duty nor priviledge in it. But however, it is and ſhall ever be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and their obſervation of it, their priviledge and duty, Jude 20. <hi>Building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves together, and edifie one another, even as alſo ye do.</hi> See alſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>and Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17. Church-members muſt take heed that they meet together for the <hi>better, and not for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> as the Apoſtle told the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17. that they ſo improve their occaſional and determined meetings, as to profit and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one another. This holy Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be ſeriouſly, frequently, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritually and ſincerely obſerved of all Church-members: And if they ſhall ſo obſerve and practiſe it, in obedience to his will, and with holy deſigns and aims, namely, to pleaſe and honour God, and to profit and better their own and each others Souls; they will find it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profitable Ordinance to them, for the promoting and carrying on the grace and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Chriſt in their hearts: and it will be an effectual means to encreaſe love one to another, unite their hearts and endear affections. God will bleſs and empower it, in your dependence
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53333:128"/>on Chriſt and his free grace; to keep your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences awake, your Affections warm, and your hearts ready to every good work.</p>
               <p>Eightly: <hi>Church-Diſcipline.</hi> This Ordinance is inſtituted and appointed for the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and orderly walking: for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curing diſorders in them; and there is as much need of this Ordinance and Inſtitution as of any other, as experience ſhews. And it ſhould be ſeriouſly minded and conſidered; wiſely, and diligently obſerved and practiſed in the Church, as much as any other Ordinance of God therein. There is no Church in the world but is ſubject to diſorders, and too many irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, becauſe the Luſts, Temptations, and carnal Intereſts of ſome of the Member, are ſtrong and impetuous; which cauſes many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and diſturbances in the body, as may be ſeen in the primitive Churches. Now Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is appointed by Chriſt to heal and cure them, and without it the body cannot be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and continue in a good condition; but botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and plague-ſores will break forth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5, 7, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the principal Inſtitutions, or Ordinances of Chriſt in his Goſpel-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; which they ſhould ſeriouſly mind, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully obſerve continually, to the glory of Chriſt and their Souls profit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>WHat are Believers priviledges and ſpiritual advantages in a Church-ſtate, or as enchurched and embodied together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many and great priviledges and Soul-advantages for Believers in a Church-ſtate, which they may enjoy and improve to the promoting of their preſent and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That two are better than one,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.9, 10, 11, 12. So many knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a holy Band for mutual profit, are in a far better condition than when they walk ſingly, and alone. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. (it is ſaid) <hi>that it is not good for man to be alone; I will</hi> (ſays God) <hi>make him a help meet for him.</hi> So God <hi>knowing our frame,</hi> Pſal. 103.14. and what need we have of ſpiritual Union and Communion one with another, he hath in love and mercy, in his great pity, tenderneſs, and compaſſion to us, appointed and ordained a Church-ſtate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for us; that we might walk together in holy Brotherly love, and oneneſs of heart; <hi>ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> Eph. 3.9. and carry on a common mutual intereſt together in his fear.</p>
               <p>Firſt: <hi>Believers in a Church-ſtate ſhall have much more of the preſence of Chriſt with them,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53333:129"/>than while they walk in a ſingle capacity,</hi> as ſo many individual perſons, without a near Church Union and Communion, without their holy Band, <hi>and perfect joyning together in the ſame mind, heart and affection,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10. How often doth the word of God inform us of this? (pray read and mind, conſider and lay to heart theſe Texts,) Rev. 2.1. <hi>unto the Angel of the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>write; theſe things ſaith he, that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midſt of the Seven.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but he <hi>walketh</hi> in his Churches, in their walking with him. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in 2. Cor. 6.16. <hi>That God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them;</hi> namely, in the particular Goſpel-Church at <hi>Corinth, formed of Saints, and Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. 2 Cor. 1.1. which is undoubtedly the priviledge of all other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Churches of the Saints, Pſal. 9.11. <hi>Sing praiſes to the Lord which dwelleth in</hi> Sion. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13, 14. (ſays <hi>David</hi>) <hi>for the Lord hath choſen</hi> Sion: <hi>he hath deſired it for his Habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have deſired it.</hi> To which laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Texts, with many other of like import, the Apoſtle alludes <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. In whom you alſo are builded for a Habitation of God.</hi> For what end are they built up together? why, it is for God to dwell in. Theſe are a few of the many Texts that ſpeak of, and plainly declare this to be one of the great priviledges of Goſpel-Churches. And it is no ſmall one, but very great and full of inviting and encouraging force
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53333:130"/>and efficacy to draw and perſwade all true hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Nathaniels</hi> to joyn themſelves to them, and walk in and with them; and to provoke and ſtir up all Church-members to walk and carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo towards God, Chriſt their head, and towards one another, as to enjoy and experience the good and ſweetneſs of it; and cauſe not to obſtruct and hinder God, and by unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages to God to withdraw himſelf from them, and deprive themſelves of ſo great and glorious a priviledge, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. It is not enough that you are in a true Goſpel-Church, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs you of this priviledge, but you muſt walk and demean your ſelves in that ſtate according to his will: you muſt walk therein <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and in heart and practiſe Conform unto his Laws and appointments: that your Father, head and King may delight to dwell with and walk among you as in his holy Temple. For he <hi>is in his holy Temple,</hi> Pſal. 11.4. Eph. 2.21. Oh! remember, <hi>that God is great, and greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of his Saints, and to be had in reverence of all that are about him:</hi> Pſal. 89.7. and conſider how great a priviledge this is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A true Goſpel-Church, or Believers inchurched, are and ſhall be priviledged with more of Chriſt his Graces, Spirit and benefits, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Chriſt will impart and diſtribute more fully and richly to them of his riches of love and grace, when they carry themſelves obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to him in a Church-ſtate, than when they walk as individual and ſingle perſons. His hand and heart ſhall be opened wider to them, and he will abundantly bleſs them, when orderly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53333:130"/>walking in his holy Temples. They may hope, expect and wait for great things from him in his holy walkes, Gardens and Galleries.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe he dwells there. There he dwells and walks (as you heard before) and be ſure where the King of glory keeps his Court and place of reſidence; where he makes his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and that with greateſt delight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, as he doth in his Goſpel-Churches, there he will communicate and impart moſt of his riches and choiceſt loves and favours. The conſideration of which, made <hi>David</hi> ſo earneſt and importunate in his deſires and prayers to be in the houſe of God, which he preferred much above and beyond all other good in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. There he knew that God would meet him, and he ſhould meet God. There he expected to find the fulleſt, cleareſt, comfortableſt, and the moſt conſtant preſence of God, and there he expected to obtain and enjoy his love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours alſo: for <hi>God is great in</hi> Zion, Pſal. 99.2. namely, great in glory, praiſe, renown, and in the diſtributions of his favours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, they ly in the way of them, and wait at <hi>wiſdoms gate,</hi> and at <hi>Bethefda's-Pool.</hi> Believers in a Church-ſtate are waiting on and for their Lord and King, and for his favours and bleſſings, in the way and ways he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and appointed to bleſs them in. And therefore their receivings muſt needs be more abundant from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. ult. <hi>As the dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the dew that deſcended upon the Mountains of</hi> Zion; <hi>for there the Lord commanded the bleſſing; even life for evermore.</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53333:131"/>Every Ordinance of Chriſt is as a full Breſt, golden Pipe, and Honey-Comb, which conveys and yields abundance of Milk and Honey, of Cordials and water of life, to nouriſh, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and refreſh the City of God, by which they are, or may be made fat and fruitful. The Springs, Treaſures and Fountain of love and grace is opened in and to the Churches, and there Chriſt Jeſus cauſes the <hi>Horn of his</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>to flouriſh,</hi> Pſal. 132.17. In a Church-ſtate, Believers live in the ſtreams of all Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and therefore they may grow there, as <hi>Willows by the Water-courſes;</hi> Eſa. 44.4. for there they may <hi>with joy, draw water out of theſe Wells of Salvation,</hi> Eſa. 12.3. The more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Believers are to the will of their King, the more he will bleſs them, and communicate of himſelf and his Grace to them, <hi>Joh</hi> 14.13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7, 10. Now in a Church-ſtate they do give up themſelves in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, profeſſed and avowed obedience, to the whole will of Chriſt, and put themſelves under all the Ordinances of Chriſt, and ſo under all the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, which are to be communicated to their Souls by them</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath promiſed to impart his loves and favours to his people, in their walking with him in a Church-ſtate and Relation, in a eſpecial manner, Cant. 7.12. <hi>Let us get up early to the Vineyards</hi> (the Churches and Ordinances of God in them): <hi>there will I give thee my loves</hi> Pſal. 92.12, 13, 14. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm-Tree; he ſhall grow like a Cedar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi> Well might <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe,</hi> Pſal. 84.4. For great and glorious are their proviſions, priviledges and advantages, to help and encourage them in their journey towards Heaven, God hath alſo promiſed to bleſs, yea <hi>abundantly to bleſs his Churches proviſions, and to ſatisfie their poor with Bread;</hi> that is, to fill and impower his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their Miniſtry, with his Preſence, Grace and Spirit, that they may greatly profit their Souls, and nouriſh them up to eternal life, <hi>Pſal</hi> 132.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God loves &amp; delights moſt in his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or in Believers walking together in the faith and order of the Goſpel, in an inchurched ſtate, Pſal. 87.2, 3. <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of</hi> Zion, <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things are ſpoken of thee, O City of God,</hi> Selah, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee</hi> (viz Zion, verſ. 16.) <hi>

               <p n="5">5. Churches or Believers in a Church-ſtate,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53333:132"/>do Chriſt more ſervice than when they walk ſingly, and out of that Goſpel-way and order. They are now his living publick witneſſes: his Candleſticks that hold up his burning Candles, and they are his ſhining lights in the World. They are the ſeats and ſubjects of all his Goſpel-Ordinances, and the ground and pillars of truth. They do publickly and openly own and profeſs him to be their Lord and King, and to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Laws and Authority, and declare themſelves his true and loyal friends and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that before all men. They manifeſt in the face of the Sun, that they are not aſhamed of his yoke, nor his ſo much deſpiſed word and ways, but own them, cleave to them and walk in them, as the only good, holy and ſafe ways. Many ſpiritual Diamonds orderly ſet in one gold Ring, Church form, do caſt their luſtre and reflect their glittering light and beauty on each other, and ſo make a more lovely and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſight to Beholders. There they do, or may wait on God their Father, and Chriſt their Head and King, with their praiſes and melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harps, and that with one heart and ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.1. Their harmonious conſent in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth their oneneſs, love, faith, hope and delight into one anothers hearts, doth greatly raiſe heat, and animate one another, in powring out their joynt love, affections and praiſes into the ears and heart of Chriſt, which is moſt love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſant unto him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They expoſe themſelves to greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the World, in a Church-ſtate, than in walking ſingly. A Church is as a <hi>Beacon</hi> ſet on a Hill which is viſible to all beholders, and by

The World takes more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a hundred Saints walking in cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate communion in a Church-ſtate, than of five thouſands of others who walk ſingly. This is ſo obvious to all, as that it needs no further proof to confirm it. Now then, the more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers expoſe themſelves to ſufferings in the Lords ways, and for his ſake, the more of his preſence and bleſſings they ſhall have, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15, 16. <hi>chapters.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As Believers inchurched are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with more of the preſence of God, and the Communications of his love and favours, <hi>ſo likewiſe with mutual help and aſſiſtance from one another.</hi> Their nearneſs in Union, Fellowſhip and Communion, their knowledge of and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with each other, together with the Laws of Chriſt among them enjoyning them thereunto, and brotherly love reſulting from all capacitates, enables, quickens and encourages them to more and conſtant uſefulneſs to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, than otherwiſe they could or would be. Their holy and ſpiritual Intimacy and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, begets and preſerves warm, hearty and ſtrong love and affection one to another, which inclines their hearts to mind and do their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duties to each other. It prompts and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53333:133"/>puts them upon <hi>ſympathiſing</hi> one with another, on <hi>watching</hi> over one another, on <hi>exhorting, comforting and provoking one another to love and to good works,</hi> Heb. 10.24, 25. to reprove, admoniſh, and endeavour to <hi>heal each other,</hi> when need requires, Gal. 6.1, 2. <hi>to edifie one another, warn the unruly, and ſupport the weak,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.11, 14. And is not this a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and advantage to our Souls, to have ſuch ſeaſonable aſſiſtance one from another? Is it not a great priviledge, when I am tempted and burdened, to have my Brethrens hands under me, to ſupport and ſtrengthen me? when by my heedleſneſs I have fallen and broken my bones, wounded and weakned my Soul to have ſuch a ſpiritual <hi>Phyſician</hi> to give me Phyſick? ſuch a good <hi>Samaritan</hi> at hand, to <hi>pour in Wine and Oyl into my wounds?</hi> Luk. 10.33, 34. Surely, none who are indeed concerned in their own Souls concernments, but will eaſily acknowledg it is. There is or ought to be a ſpiritually <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural care</hi> in ſound-hearted Church-members to one another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. <hi>They rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep,</hi> Rom. 12.15. and <hi>remember them that are in bonds, as being bound with them,</hi> Heb. 13.3. You may expect it, yea require it of one another; for you who are joyned together in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip and relation, are as much concerned in each others Soul concerns, as the Members of the natural body, are with one another. And one of Gods holy ends in uniting and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together in one body and ſpiritual ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is, that they might help, ſuccour, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, reprove, exhort, edifie, comfort, watch
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53333:133"/>over, ſerve and heal one another; To further each other in all duties, and in the love and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Goſpel-holineſs and Righteouſneſs; as alſo to preſerve each other from ſin and affliction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Churches of Chriſt are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and benefited with a Miniſtry and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their own:</hi> ſo that they need not go to ſtrangers to fetch bread, but to ſuch as they have a ſpecial intereſt in and relation to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have Miniſters, or Paſtours and Elders ſent by Chriſt, and ſet among them by his grace and Authority; to feed and nouriſh them; to teach and eſtabliſh them; to admoniſh and reprove them; to exhort and comfort them; to watch and take the overſight of them; to Miniſter all the Ordinances of Chriſt to them; and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the ſervice of their Souls: and they are ſuch as he hath <hi>promiſed to be with all, in all their work and labour of love,</hi> Math. 28.20. They are ſuch as he hath promiſed to bleſs to them, to furniſh them with his Spirit and grace, and to ſucceed their Miniſtry, and proſper their endeavours to the ſpiritual profit of their Souls, <hi>Pſal</hi> 132.15, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Other Saints who walk not in the order of the Goſpel, have not <hi>Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> of their own, between whom there is ſo near a Relation, Union and Communion. For their Teachers cannot call their Auditors their own flocks, as the Churches Paſtors and Teachers may call their Churches their own. For the Churches and their Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are each others by free, hearty and mutual choice, and by cordial and mutual engagement.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53333:134"/>Their Paſtors and Teachers are the fruit of their prayers and tears, and of Chriſt his Death and Aſcenſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12. Churches may claim their Paſtors Gifts, Authority, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Abilities, as theirs, and make uſe of them as their own right and property, given to them by Chriſt, for their good to edification. They may repair to, and make uſe of them in any material Soul-caſe or caſes. However ſome look on, and account of this matter; yet I have ever valued it as a great Church-priviledge, namely, that they have a ſpecial and peculiar Miniſtry of their own, whoſe work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to wait on the ſervice and concernments of their Souls; and they being ſent to them, and ſetled among them by Chriſt in love and mercy, and the fruit of their own prayers, choice and deſires, they ſhall be, &amp; are undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly bleſſed in their labours, to the profit of all ſincere hearts amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: <hi>Goſpel-Churches are the proper ſeats and ſubjects of all the ſpiritual</hi> Ordinances of Chriſt; which is one part of their honour, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and renown. What is ſaid of the Miniſters and Miniſtry of Chriſt, is in this matter true of all other Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.28. <hi>And God hath ſet in his Church Apoſtles, Prophets and Teachers; ſo</hi> Eph. 4. that is he hath appointed Teachers and all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for, and placed them in his Churches. <hi>The Churches are his Temples, Houſes, Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Vineyards, Walks, his reſting and dwelling places</hi> (as was ſhewed): now where doth God ſet and ſix his Ordinances of Divine worſhip, but in them? To whom are Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53333:134"/>given? to whom is the Lords Supper and Diſcipline given, but to the Churches? They are the ſeats and ſubjects of them, and none elſe, that we can find in the Scriptures. The Lord Jeſus hath given to and ſet among them his Goſpel-worſhip and Ordinances: among them he dwells, and of them he expects the honour and worſhip due unto his name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2. God keeps houſe in his Goſpel Churches, and there he hath his Houſhold about him, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and doing honour to him: and that they might do all according to his holy will, he hath given them his Ordinances and Goſpel-Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to expreſs and manifeſt their dependance on and obedience to him in, as to their head and King: God made the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old Teſtament the ſeat and ſubject of all his then inſtituted worſhip and Ordinances, and under the Goſpel-diſpenſation he hath made new Teſtament particular Churches, the ſeat and ſubjects of all his Goſpel-Ordinances. The Catholick Church as ſuch, cannot be the ſeat and ſubject of them, for that cannot aſſemble, or meet together in one place to celebrate and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them: the World, or viſible unbelievers cannot be the ſeat and ſubject of them; for they are no where ſaid to be given to them, neither are they capable (while in their ſtate of enmity againſt Chriſt) of them: Therefore they muſt be the Churches dowry's, rights and priviledges, and none other perſons, or ſocieties whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Whileſt Believers neglect to walk in a Church-ſtate and relation, they deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this and many other priviledges, and Soul-advantages: and it is no ſmall wrong they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53333:135"/>do their Souls thereby. It may be ſaid of all Goſpel-Churches, as <hi>Moſes</hi> told the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 4.7, 8. <hi>for what people is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things we call upon him for?</hi> And what people is there ſo great that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</p>
               <p>Sixthly: <hi>Goſpel-Churches, or Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched are priviledged with ſafety and ſecurity.</hi> They are Gardens encloſed, Cant. 4.12. <hi>A Garden incloſed is my Siſter, my Spouſe, a Spring ſhut up, a Fountain ſealed.</hi> A wall or hedge in our Gardens to ſecure them from Beaſts and evil Men, and we are more careful of, and at greater coſt and pains in and about them, than about our Fields. So the Lord Jeſus lays out, and expends more care, coſt and charge, in and about his Goſpel-Gardens, than about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Men are moſt watchful and careful of and about their Houſes and places of reſidence and abode, where they live, expect and take moſt delight. Now where doth God make his abode, and Chriſt the Lord, keep his Court? Is it not in his Churches (as was before proved)? They are his Temples, Houſes, Vineyards, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Habitations, Walks and Palaces; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and reſting places: and will he not be moſt careful and mindful of them, for his own honour and glory; and their good? Believers in living on and walking with God in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, are of all perſons, in the beſt and ſafeſt condition. They are under the greateſt ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from <hi>Seductions and Satanical Deluſions</hi> from back-ſliding, and Apoſtacies, from the Spirit of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53333:135"/>Error and Hereſies, from ſpiritual decays and witherings, from hardneſs of heart, or from being hardened and ſtupified through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs, and enſnaring allurements of this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. For they have greater and more conſtant means and proviſions for their preſervation and ſecurity, than others have. They have more promiſes of being ſecured by their Lord and King, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27.2, 3. <hi>Sing ye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her a Vineyard of red Wine. I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> They have the Lords preſence and glory, his love, grace and benefits frequently before their eyes, to warn, quicken and keep them awake and watchful, diligent and faithful, and they have freſh ſprings often flowing in upon their hearts. They are much in the eye of Chriſt, and he is much in their eye, which keeps an awe on them; and the frequent views of his glorious perſon, love, grace, Laws and Ordinances are of great uſe towards their ſafety. So alſo is the watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, help and aſſiſtance they have from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Church-ſtate. Believers walking ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly and diſorderly, as they do, when not joyned to ſome true Church of Chriſt, they are as common fields that lye open to all ſorts of Beaſts, and as Souldiers walking and ſtragling without the Camp, ready to become a prey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Enemies: But in a Church-ſtate, and walking with God therein, they are as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den walled in, as a Caſtle and City, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ates and Barrs, and as a Houſhold of perſons ſhut in, with doors and locks. They are hedged in with Chriſt his Diſcipline, and ſecured with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53333:136"/>his watchful eye and protection, ſo as that the Gates of Hell cannot ſo eaſily prevail againſt them, as they may againſt others.</p>
               <p>Seventhly: <hi>Goſpel-Churches are very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Societies and Corporations.</hi> They are exalted and dignified ſo by Chriſt, and that they are the moſt high, excellent, as honourable Houſes and Cities in the World. They are the Houſes and Houſholds of the great <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15. Pſal. 48.1, 2, 3. Eph. 2.19, 20, 21, 22. A Houſe built up, fitly framed and artificially formed of hewen ſtones and Timber, is much more honourable and glorious, than the materials whereof it was builded were, before they were ſo formed up. One holy Temple fitly framed, conſiſting of a hundred meet and well qualified perſons, hath more beauty, glory, excellency, honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown on it, than ten thouſand ſuch materials have, whilſt they lye ſcattred up and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rubbiſh of the World. And as they do more (as it were) adorn and beautifie Chriſt in the World, ſo he doth more adorn &amp; beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. They are ſaid to be <hi>beautiful for Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:</hi> Pſal. 48.2. and <hi>Gods holy Temples,</hi> Eph. 2.21. They are honoured with more of his honourable and glorious preſence, with more of his holy and ſweet Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with more of his promiſes, power, gifts and graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their honour, fame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is farr above my reach, and farr beyond what I can declare. They are made the keepers and upholders of his Truths, Name and Intereſts. Churches in their orderly and holy walkings, are <hi>terrible as an Army with Banners,</hi> Cant. 6.4,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53333:136"/>10. <hi>and glorious things are ſpoken of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God,</hi> Pſal. 87.3. As God ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> namely, <hi>that there were none like him in the earth,</hi> Job. 8 1. So he ſaith of his New-Teſtament Churches, that there are not any Societies like them in the earth. For what other Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Societies of men are ſo qualified, that have God with them, as they have? that have ſuch a head and King, ſuch Ordinances, Laws and Law-giver, as ſuch Churches have? where are thoſe Societies to be found, that God ſpeaks ſo honourably of, and gives ſuch honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Titles to, as he doth to them? They are (or ought to be) all ſtones of Gold, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jewels:</hi> they are <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and made up of <hi>Royal Diadems,</hi> Eſa. 62.3. Rev. 2.1. Mal. 3.17. They have the Lords name written on them, and they are called by his name. They are called the Churches of God and of Chriſt. What other Societies of men are there governed by ſuch Laws, ruled by ſuch Rulers, animated by ſuch a Spirit, and fed with ſuch Heavenly bread and ſpiritual proviſions, as they are? They are the lights and glories of, or in the World, and by their joynt prayers and intereſt in Heaven, they are the ſupporters of the world. Theſe are a few of the ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of inchurched Saints, which have been dearly purchaſed for them with the blood of Chriſt, and conferred upon them by the holy Ghoſt; which they are bound to take ſpecial notice of, affect their hearts with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce greatly with them, and in the Authour of them, be very thankful for, and faithfully improve them to the glory of Chriſt, and to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53333:137"/>their own peace, comfort, incouragement in holineſs, and to their growth in grace.</p>
               <p>You that are Churches, and Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are bound to conſider and lay to heart your great, ſingular and invaluable priviledges; your unworthineſs of them; the price they have coſt your head and King; the ends for which they are given you; to walk worthy of them in your Church-ſtate and Relation, and ſee that you walk and carry your ſelves honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in all your ways towards God and men. And remember, that God gives you all theſe and other priviledges and injoyments, that you ſhould be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> yea that you might <hi>abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18. 1 Cor. 15. ult. Your priviledges are ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and glorious: Oh! ſo let your words, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, deeds and performances be alſo. God hath dignified you; do you ſee that you exalt him. God hath done great things for you; do you do great things for him; you ſhall reap the benefit, and he the glory.</p>

They may not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or careleſly neglect to do it one day, after they have opportunities offered them: they are not, cannot be diſpenſed withal in their Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for their wilful or careleſs neglects are their ſins. They are by ſuch neglects guilty of diſobedience and contempt.

               <p>Firſt: <hi>The Lord Chriſt hath erected, inſtituted and appointed Churches for this end</hi> (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) <hi>namely, that his called and ſanctified peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be the matter of them, that they might joyn and walk together in them, and that they might be the materials of them.</hi> This ſtate and condition is not ordained and appointed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, but only for the <hi>Holy Seed;</hi> for God will not keep Houſe with unregenerate and unholy perſons, but with his <hi>choſen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Royal Prieſthood</hi> he will. That parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregational Churches are of divine Inſtitution, hath been already proved: and if ſo, then it will follow that God's people ſhould joyn to, and walk with them; or elſe to what purpoſe are they appointed, inſtituted, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Jeſus Chriſt, If none are bound in duty, yea, if all God's people (that can) are not bound in duty and compliance with the Lords ends, to become Churches, joyn to, and walk in and with them? then this Order and Inſtitution of Chriſt is in vain; he hath appointed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted that which none are, or will be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by; which ſurely was far from the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts and intentions of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>the Wiſdom and Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. For the Lord hath <hi>made all things for himſelf,</hi> and ordained them for his own Glory and the profit of his people. He hath made nothing in vain. It is far below him to do it, and below reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures to imagine it. And 2. It will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that whoever joyn themſelves to ſuch Churches, they do it not as duty to God and their own ſouls, but as an act of their own will and pleaſure, without any reſpect to, or regard
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53333:141"/>had of the Will of God, and their own ſpiritual good, ſo are guilty of Superſtition and Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, which God loaths and abhors. The very Inſtitution proves it ſufficiently to be our duty to joyn with, and become Members of ſome particular Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>The unanimous and univerſal Votes of all the Primitive Saints do prove this Truth.</hi> Thoſe good men that were converted to Chriſt by the Apoſtles Preaching, with, and amongſt whom they lived and convers'd, and ſuch as they planted, fed and watered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and theſe both Jews and Gentiles; they do all of them by their conſtant practice witneſs to, and confirm what I ſay. Look where you will in the Stories of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where you read of the Apoſtles Preaching, and Men Converted; there, or in <hi>Pauls Epiſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you ſhall find the young Converts <hi>giving up themſelves to the Lord, and to one another by the Will of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. We find them by and by inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and walking in a Church-ſtate and relation. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. ult. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. And were not all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles (that to <hi>Philemon</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which was written upon a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) wrote and ſent to the Churches, or to, and for Believers, as inchurched and imbodied together, that they might <hi>know how to behave themſelves in the Houſe</hi> or Houſes of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, their Elders, and one another? They are expreſly called Churches, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, and of Chriſt, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now all Believers are charged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to follow their examples and practice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53333:142"/>of them; who through Faith and Patience Inherit the Promiſes,</hi> that is, ſee and mark them in their walkings; obſerve how they lived and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and do you ſo likewiſe. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed could not abide with the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to which he was joyned as a Member, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26, 27, 28. becauſe he was ſent to Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the Gentiles. But as oft as he could, he joyned and walked with the Churches, as you may often find in reading the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Now ſays he to the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> chap. 3.17. <hi>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them who walk ſo, as ye have us for an enſample.</hi> This Commandement is for you who are in Chriſt, that you walk as <hi>Paul</hi> and other Primitive Saints walked. If it was their duty and practiſe, as you ſee it was, (for they gave themſelves to the Lord, and to one another by the Will of God that is, they Congregated and inchurched themſelves, not by, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own wills, but by, and according to the Will of God) then I ſay, it is the duty of all other Saints, and it ought to be their practiſe likewiſe. For, <hi>whatſoever was written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> (namely, of the Saints duty and approved practiſe) <hi>was written for our Learning, that we,</hi> who ſucceed them in their Faith and Priviledges, in their Hope and Profeſſion, might follow them in practiſe alſo. If we look for, and expect the ſame Covenant-mercies and bleſſings that they had, we muſt practiſe the ſame duties, and walk as they did. The Primitive Saints were commended and renowned for their orderly walking in a Church-ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and often elſe-where, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53333:142"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>All Believers ought to walk in Church-fellowſhip, by virtue of their Marriage-Covenant.</hi> When by the power of Grace, and the Spirits operations in their hearts, they were perſwaded to make Chriſt their choice, and took, received and embraced him on his own terms, they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged themſelves to be his, choſe his Laws and Ordinances for theirs, and bound themſelves to him, to walk with him, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto him in all things, to keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to love and practiſe all his Laws, and to conform in heart and practiſe unto all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Inſtitutions; as <hi>David, Zachary, Elizabeth,</hi> and other Saints of God had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Thus in effect do all truly-convinced, and ſincere-hearted Believers do, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or married unto Chriſt by Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. Now then, being thus bound, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus bound and obliged themſelves to Chriſt, they ought for ever to do and perform, to walk and practiſe accordingly; which they do not until they give up themſelves to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and walk together in Goſpel fellowſhip, in the conſcientious Obſervation of all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Appointments of Jeſus Chriſt. For until they do ſo, they walk not in univerſal Obedience to all the Laws and Orders of their Head and King. For beſides their diſorderly walking, they live in the careleſs, if not wilful neglect of ſeveral Duties and Ordinances given to, and incumbent on the Churches, as the Lords Supper, and many brotherly Duties one to another. You have heard before, that a true Church of Chriſt is the ſeat and ſubject of all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53333:143"/>Goſpel Ordinances; and if ſo, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that thither Believers ſhould repair for, and ſeek to find them; there they ſhould walk and obſerve them, and no where elſe, excepting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally. For out of a Church-ſtate they do not orderly obſerve the Ordinances and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of Chriſt in what they do. Many think that they do well, and diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Chriſt and their own ſouls, if they obſerve and wait on ſome Ordinances, if their hearts be upright with God in their ſo doing; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the order and method, the places and waies they ought to obſerve and practiſe them in: But herein they are miſtaken, and walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly. It was the Will of God, that the <hi>Ark of his Covenant</hi> ſhould be brought to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> and the Prieſts did well in attempting to do it; but they failed in the external manner of doing it, and therefore God <hi>made a breach on them</hi> 1 Chron. 15.13. The Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> did well in offering Sacrifice to God; but they failed in offering their Sacrifice with <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> Lev. 10. And are not theſe things <hi>written for our Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition?</hi> 1 Cor. 13.11. undoubtedly they are. God hath Inſtituted Churches, and appointed them to be the ſeats and ſubjects of all his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances and Inſtitutions; invited and called his people to, or into them to celebrate them there. Now when any content themſelves with the enjoyment and obſervation of ſome Ordinances and Goſpel-Inſtitutions, and attend on them out of a Church-ſtate, as if they found them where they ought to ſeek them: they walk irregularly, and break their Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by their careleſs or wilful neglects. For
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53333:143"/>how are they univerſally obedient to all his Laws and Ordinances, when they take up with, and only reſpect ſome of them, and ſuch as they do obſerve, they obſerve not in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or in a right manner? Oh! think on this, you who live ſo, and what the end will be. Oh! conſider what promiſes you have made to Chriſt, and what Obligations you lay under to him; and examine (ſeriouſly) your ſelves, if you live not in the wilful or careleſs breach of them, and ſo lay your ſelves open to the wrath and diſpleaſure of your Lord and King, and by your neglects provoke him to make a breach on you. O remember, what obligations you live under, <hi>To give Him the Honour due unto his Name,</hi> in and by univerſal Obedience unto his holy Will in all things. 1. You have his Will and your duty revealed and opened to you in his Goſpel, and further explained by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. 2. You are greatly obliged and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his mercies and promiſes. 3. You are firmly bound by your own act and deed, by your own free and voluntary Covenants and Engagements: and therefore you may not live any longer in the neglect of any of Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Appointments, And conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that while you live in ſuch neglects, you <hi>Rob</hi> God of his Dues; you detain his Right of Homage and Service, from him, which will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly have bitterneſs in the end; and inſtead of being called and intitled <hi>Obedient Children,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14. you will incur the odious Name and Title of Diſobedient, if not Stubborn and Rebellious Children.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:53333:144"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Believers ought to joyn themſelves to, and walk in Church-fellowſhip for their own Souls ſakes, for their own profit and ſpiritual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi> They ſtand in need of all God's means to help them on in their journey and ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, through the Wilderneſs of this world, as experience ſhews. It is well known that all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have their Entanglements, Tryals, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Oppoſitions, Weights, Burdens, and Weakneſſes: The beſt of Saints have them, and are not a little incumbred and preſſed by them. Now God the Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt have in their great Love and Kindneſs to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers made and provided, offered and given to them ſutable and proper means for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſtrengthening, comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to feed and nouriſh, to edifie and build up their Souls and Graces, and that by impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and communicating of his Spirit, Truth, Love and Grace unto their Souls, in and by thoſe means. They are appointed and given to them for their own profit and the glory of God. Such is the Love of Jeſus Chriſt unto his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, as that he hath conjoyned and made their preſent and eternal happineſs one and the ſame end with his own Honour and Glory in all the diſpenſations of his Graces, and in all his Promiſes and Goſpel-Laws; ſo that they are not two, but one End and Intereſt, wherein his free Love and Grace ſhines forth moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Now as God told a Remnant among the Jews, <hi>That he ſent them into Captivity for their good,</hi> Jer. 24.5. So he hath made and appointed Churches, and ſet his Goſpel-Ordinances in them for his peoples good, that they may come
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53333:144"/>there and reap the fruits and profits of them. Therefore they ought to do it, and not upon any Pretence whatſoever to neglect it; for if they refuſe to come and take them, as they in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. may not the great God reprove and condemn them for their wilful neglects and careful refuſals, as he did them? He <hi>made a great Supper, a feaſt of fat things,</hi> Iſa. 25. bid and invited men to come eat of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but they made excuſes for their neglects: ſo he hath made a Heavenly Feaſt for Believers, invited them to come, to eat and drink freely and abundantly for the ſupply of their wants, and making them fat and flouriſhing: But they will not come into his Houſe or Houſes, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his dainties, although they ſtand in need of it, are lovingly and importunately invited by their God and King, their Head and Husband, to come freely, dwell in his Houſe, feed on his Banquets, lye in his Boſom, and refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with his Delights; but they will not do it. They ſtand off, as if they were not concerned in thoſe matters, had no need of them, or not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to come.</p>
               <p>They frequently complain and cry out of their wants, weakneſſes, barrenneſs, cold and dead-heartedneſs; of the ſtrength and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Luſts and Temptations, of their ignorance, ſadneſs, and carnality. And although they have proviſions made in their Fathers Houſes, and in their Kings Palaces, to help and relieve them, to warm and teach them, to melt and ſoften them, to arm and ſtrengthen them, to comfort and chear them, to water &amp; make them fruitful; yet how ſinfully and ſhamefully do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53333:145"/>of them neglect to come and take, to accept and make uſe of their love and goodneſs to them? but they will rather ſtand in the ſtreets complaining, than come into their Fathers Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where they may have ſupplies of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food for their ſouls. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt keeps Houſe in his Churches, where he is very liberal in his diſtributions. In them are his <hi>Magazins,</hi> his <hi>Treaſures</hi> of Grace and Love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. There <hi>He gives forth his Loves,</hi> and cauſes the Fountain to flow, for the enriching of the Poor, filling the Hungry, and ſatisfying the Thirſty. There Souls ſhall find Food for the Belly, and Cloathing for the Back. There <hi>the weary ſoul ſhall reſt, and the troubled ſoul ſhall find peace.</hi> There the fainting ſhall find Cordials, and the diſeaſed Soul ſhall find <hi>Phyſick,</hi> to heal him. There the pained Soul ſhall find caſe, and the weak ſhall find ſtrength. There broken bones ſhall be ſet in joynt; and doubting ſouls reſolved. There they may find the good things they want and deſire, and there they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſatisfaction to their Souls. Would they ſee <hi>Zions King</hi> and their beloved Lord and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his beauty and glory? There they may obtain their deſires. Would they grow in Grace, and increaſe with the increaſe of God? why there they may obtain it. Would they be ſealed up to the day of their Redemption, and have a clear <hi>Earneſt of their eternal Inheritance?</hi> why, in a Church-ſtate they may have it. In a word, there good men may find all good to their ſouls; <hi>For God will with-hold no good thing from them who walk uprightly in</hi> a Church-ſtate, and in all the Commandments and Ordinances of God
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53333:145"/>therein blameleſly. Well then, if it be your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to look after, to mind and induſtriouſly to ſeek the welfare of your own ſouls, (as all will readily acknowledg it is) then it will undeniably follow, that you ought to ſeek it in all the ways and means God hath appointed and given to you for that end and purpoſe. Now what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual means have you to expect and ſeek for ſuch mercies and ſoul-bleſſings in? where can you expect and hope to find them, but in the Temples, Houſes, Walks, Palaces and Houſholds of your God and King? That you need them, you know, and that there you may find and experience them, you may believe. Oh! that you would be perſwaded to come and ſee, come and taſt, to come and prove the Truth of what I ſay. If you will not, but continue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide as you are, practically ſlight and neglect the rich proviſions that your God and Father hath made for you in his Churches; you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to thrive and proſper, but to continue in, and under your Wants, Barrenneſs, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Weakneſs, Doubts and Fears; under your Faintings, Sadneſſes, Witherings &amp; Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſpirit. If you will ſtill refuſe the means, and neglect to come and take the mercies of the New Covenant; you will grieve the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and provoke him to depart from you, and carry away his bleſſings with him. It is your preſent and eternal good that I ſeek and intend in what I ſay, and the ſame end had your Lord God in appointing this condition and making ſuch proviſions for you. I wonder how Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers can, and that they dare live one day out of a Church-ſtate, and in the wilful neglect of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53333:146"/>ſo many precious and ſoul-enriching Ordinances and Duties: how they can ſatisfie themſelves in their ways and walkings, and with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they can draw near to God, whilſt under ſo much guilt. I wonder how they can call God Father, apply the Promiſes, and appropriate to themſelves the good of them, while they walk ſo irregularly and diſobediently as they do. Surely they little mind their own ſouls concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the Name and Honour of Jeſus Chriſt, whilſt htey neglect to obſerve ſo many of his good Laws and Ordinances, and to make uſe of their own purchaſed Priviledges, and that, whilſt their Souls ſtand in great need of them.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we are afraid that we are not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and qualified for Church-memberſhip, and that we have no right to the Childrens Bread there, and therefore we dare not joyn our ſelves unto the holy Churches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may be (indeed) a great caſe with ſome, and it may be a ſtumbling block in their way of walking as they ought to do. They love Chriſt and his People, his ways and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but dare not walk in the neareſt Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with them, becauſe they think themſelves unworthy of their Society and the Ordinances of God among them. Now where it is ſo indeed, they ſin not as others do, who neglect not their duties and priviledges on this account, but on other. All that I ſhall ſay to this ſort of Neglecters, is (1.) That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will not wholly excuſe them either before God or Men. For 1. They are no where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with their neglect of duty upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; or they have no diſpenſation to neglect
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53333:146"/>to do their duty, and wait on God for his grace to better them in his ways and means on that account. For if they might on that account be diſpenſed withal in the omiſſion of their duty, and uſing God's means to better them; by the ſame rule they may neglect and claim a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the omiſſion of Prayer, and other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Ordinances under this pretence, that they cannot <hi>worſhip God in Spirit and Truth as God requires all to worſhip him,</hi> Joh. 4.23, 24. Heb. 10.22, and therefore they may not, will not worſhip him at all. 2. It is probable that their fears and ſcruples ariſe from the Devils temptations and wiles, and from their own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſciences. They know that they do not walk with God, ſubdue their Luſts, deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and endeavour to know their own ſtates and conditions. They carry about accuſing and condemning Conſciences, which the Devil ſets in with, and works them to his will and deſign, and ſo they are afraid of God, of their duties and priviledges; for they might prevent theſe evils, and know in ſome degrees their ſtates, if they would. 3. One uſe and end of Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Ordinances of Chriſt therein, is to convey into Believers hearts the aſſurance of their good ſtates and conditions. They are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained for them, to wait for it in them, and for the holy Spirit to give and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to their Souls there. And therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſeek for it there, they may not expect to find it; for if we uſe not the means, how can we hope to obtain the ends of them. 4. If their ſcruples and objections ariſe from real darkneſs of mind, and tenderneſs of Conſcience, without
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53333:147"/>guilt, then I adviſe them to conſider and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what are indeed the neceſſary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Church-members, and enquire if they are not in them in ſome good meaſure. And for your ſatisfaction therein, I refer you unto the <hi>third Chapter</hi> of this Book, beginning at <hi>page</hi> the 47th. and ending at <hi>page</hi> the 55. where you will find <hi>ten qualifications</hi> requiſite for Church-memberſhip, and helps to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſelves, if they be in you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore read them, and try your ſelves by them; and know, that if you are ſo qualified, or if you can find theſe ſigns of grace in you, that then you are in a meet condition for Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to partake of all the Ordinances of God's Houſe, what ever elſe you may want.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is another ſort of Neglecters of Church-fellowſhip, and they are ſuch whoſe neglects ariſe from their careleſneſs, indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, cold-heartedneſs, ſtupidity, and woful inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and not from ſcruples of Conſcience, or fears of their unworthineſs. They ſee not, feel not their need of God's means and ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; they know not the worth, neither do they ſee any tranſcendent excellency in them, wherefore they ſhould deſire them: And hence it is that they regard and deſire them not; they have back-ſlidden from God, and He is departed from them, ſhines not on their ſouls to keep them ſoft and tender, nor waters them with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dews, to make them compliant with his Will: So that when they are called upon to conſider their ways, put themſelves under all the Ordinances of Gods Houſe, and joyn in the neareſt band of Communion with his People,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53333:147"/>they turn a deaf ear to all that is ſaid unto them; and yet theſe will pretend ſtrange things for their neglects alſo. They will have their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and objections too, and they cannot do ſo, becauſe of ſuch and ſuch things in the Churches. They have their weakneſſes, miſcarriages and defects, and therefore they cannot joyn with them. They have the ſight of Beams, or they ſee great Faults among ſuch Congregations, as otherwiſe they would congregate withal; but they ſee none at home, or at beſt, but ſome little Motes in themſelves. They are too good for ſuch Churches, and the Churches are too bad for their Communion. They ſee all the faults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, none, or very few at home in themſelves; and they think that this will excuſe their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects; but they are miſtaken; for if themſelves are ſo good and faultleſs, and the Churches faulty in this or that, they ſhould the rather joyn with them, and by their goodneſs and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, endeavour to better and mend them by their wiſe Counſels and holy Converſations, as knowing that all Churches, as Churches, have their Buts, as well as particular Believers their own perſonal Buts. This is the careleſs Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men, who have loſt their God and hearts in Earthly things, and buried themſelves and graces under the clods of worldly cares, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and pleaſures, and ſo are regardleſs of their own ſouls, and indifferent what becomes of them. This, together with carnal ſelf-love and ſond affections to the good things of this world, eager deſires after the getting and keeping them, and indulged fears of loſing them, lays at the bottom of all their neglects; although other
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53333:148"/>pretences there are, or other obſtructions are pretended for them, to ſet a fair face on a foul matter. This Conſcience will tell them, if they will hearken to it, and give it leave to ſpeak out all it hath to ſay in the caſes againſt them.</p>
               <p>Let me then exhort you in the Prophet's words, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5.7. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Conſider your ways, and ſearch and try your ways.</hi> Ask the queſtion in good earneſt, and put it home to your own Conſciences, and deſire them to ſpeak out plainly, and tell you clearly, what obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or matters they are, that keep you from helping to build the Lord's Houſe or Houſes, that hinder you from <hi>going up to the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe, from appearing before God in</hi> Zion, <hi>and paying your Vows in the Mountain of his Holineſs.</hi> And ſee if that doth not hinder you, which did hinder the Jews in <hi>Haggai's</hi> days; (what their hinderances were, you may read in that Book at large) And are they not the evils that hinder you from joyning your ſelves to the Churches of Chriſt, and celebrating his worſhip, and partaking of his holy Ordinances there? Are not the greateſt lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within you, and ſome from a worldly concern without you? Do you not conſult fleſh and blood, and the will of the fleſh in the caſe, and not the will of God? and do you not find a conteſt ſomtimes in you between Conſcience and Self, Conſcience and the World? Doth not Conſcience ſomtimes bid you go and joyn your ſelves to the People and Ordinances of God, and then you think of doing ſo, and then appears Self and the World and forbids you, calls you back again, and puts you into another
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53333:148"/>mood, becauſe you hearken to their voyce, and not to Conſcience, which ſpake to you from God, for God and your own Souls. Well then, do not ſtand any longer in your Neglects on vain and groundleſs objections, and pretended ſcruples, but ſtick to your duty; <hi>Give your ſelves to the Lord; and to his People by the will of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5. Acts 2.41, 42, 43. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly: You ought to joyn your ſelves to God's People, and walk in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel with them, in the celebration of divine Ordinances of worſhip, <hi>for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſake,</hi> for his Name, Authority, Intereſt, and Glory's ſake; for that his Honour and Glory is concerned in your ſo doing as well as your own good. You heard before, that Goſpel-Churches are his <hi>Temples, Walks, Palaces, Delights, and Habitations;</hi> that they are his <hi>Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, the Seats and Subjects of his Goſpel-Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, the Beauties of his Holineſs,</hi> and that they are his great and living <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in the World. Now as a ſtately and well-built Houſe affords much more honour and renown to a great man, than ten thouſand times as many materials, whereof the ſaid Houſe is built, whilſt they lay ſcattered up and down in the world; ſo a company of holy perſons formed up into a holy Temple by the Word and Spirit, do more honour and glorifie the Lord Chriſt, than ten thouſands of Saints can do, whilſt they walk up and down as ſcattered ſtones among others. Chriſt accounts himſelf much exalted by his People, when they do it together <hi>with one heare and mouth,</hi> Rom. 15.6. We ought to cauſe our light to ſhine as clearly as poſſible before the

                     </gap> glorifie God,</hi> Matth. 5.16. The world knows not what to make of Profeſſors, whilſt they wall promiſcuouſly and confuſedly in, and with the world. They cannot ſo well diſcern them from other men, neither know they what to think of them, and conclude them to be; what they are, who they are for, and what they intend, when they are as ſo many individuals, as when they are knit together in fixed Congregations, and walk, live, and converſe, worſhip God, and ſerve one another together as a Family and Houſhold of God, <hi>As Brethren dwelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> Pſal. 133.1, 2. and united in a holy Band. I have ſpoken ſomewhat of this elſe-where under another head. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall only at preſent ſay, that if it be ſo, that Believers may more honour Chriſt by walking together in Goſpel or Church-fellowſhip than otherwiſe, that then they are bound in duty ſo to walk. For if it be their duty to exalt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt all they can, as certainly it is, then they are bound to uſe the means whereby they may be enabled to do it. Now Chriſt hath given to, and ſet in his Churches many Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of worſhip, and out of every one of them he expects a Revenue of Glory by his people; therefore the more of his Ordinances you have in your hand, and ſpiritually obſerve, the more is Chriſt glorified by you. Beſides this, you are in a better capacity <hi>to provoke one another to love and to good works,</hi> Heb. 10.24.25. and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame one anothers love to Chriſt, to preſerve each other from ſinning againſt him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his holy Name and ways by ſin in a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53333:152"/>Church-ſtate, than out of it. You will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be capacitated to honour the Lord Jeſus more in a Church-ſtate than otherwiſe, by grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace, and getting more Talents into your hands to Trade withall and employ for him in the Church and world, (as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore). Therefore do you no longer ſtand off, but joyn your ſelves to ſome Goſpel-Church for the Lord Jeſus ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly:</hi> You that are true Believers, ought to joyn your ſelves to ſome true Church of Chriſt. <hi>for your fellow-Members and Brethren's ſakes too.</hi> You know that we are bound to do all the good we can to one another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. to further each other in the way of holineſs to eternal happineſs. We need each others help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, and are ſet in this World to be uſeful and helpful one to another. Now by joyning our ſelves one to another, and walking together in mutual love, peace and concord, and in the ſame judgment (though not ſo in all things) way and order, in the ſame Communion, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Worſhip, we do greatly ſtrengthen the hands, chear and quicken the hearts of one another in our duties, under our burdens and Temptations, and help to make our yoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſie. We animate and ſtir up one another, and put as it were new courage, life and ſpirit into each other. But by our neglect to joyn in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with our Brethren, by being ſtrange to, and keeping at a diſtance from them, we do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much weaken their hands, ſadden, grieve and diſcourage their hearts, and lay them under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temptations, troubles and diſquietments, as experience ſhews; <hi>We ought to bear each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53333:153"/>burdens, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt;</hi> Gal. 6 2. But we may not burden one another either by Omiſſion or Commiſſion. We are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to one another by vertue of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and our ſpiritual Relation to each other; we live not from or by our ſelves, &amp; therefore muſt not live for and to our ſelves. I am my Brother's, and he is mine, as to help, comfort, ſervice and uſefulneſs one to another. Such as careleſly or wilfully abide out of Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, do in a ſenſe condemn thoſe who walk in it. We ought to know and be acquainted with one another, that we may be thereby the more ſerviceable to each other. I am my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Keeper, Teacher, Comforter, Reprover and Admoniſher, and he is mine. I cannot well live, nor ordinarily live well without his help and aſſiſtance; nor he without mine. We have our work and buſineſs to do for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as for our ſelves. The nearer and faſter Brethren are link't and knit together, the warmer and ſtronger their love will be to, and the more care and tenderneſs they will have for, and towards one another. Now though Church-fellowſhip be not the ground of Brethrens love and ſervice one to another, but their oneneſs with Chriſt, and fellow-memberſhip in him their head, as alſo his revealed will; yet it is certain in experience, that their near and cloſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together in Church-fellowſhip doth greatly provoke, irritate, ſtrengthen and draw forth their love one to another. Diſtance and ſtrangeneſs weakens love, but nearneſs and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ſtrengthens it. Church Communion is a ſpiritual bond, that tyes ſpiritual men together,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53333:153"/>and greatly knits them into one; when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their walkings they are divided and like bones out of joynt. Therefore let all true-hearted Brethren joyn in Church-fellowſhip with their Brethren, and declare their oneneſs in Chriſt, in ſpirit, faith and love, by their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let them ſtrengthen each others hands, and encourage one anothers heart in their work and duty, in their priviledges and mercies: and know that you are indiſpenſibly bound ſo to do. You have Chriſt himſelf and his ſpirit calling you: you have your own and your Brethrens Souls calling you: you have the practice of the Apoſtles and Primitive Saints calling you, and (in a ſenſe) you have the World calling you into Church-fellowſhip. Why then do it, and make no longer delay; for while you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do it, you neglect your duties to God, to your Brethren, and to your own Souls: yea, you do practically ſlight your purchaſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and dear-bought mercies; do it ſpeedily for Chriſt's ſake, and for your own peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, growth and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly:</hi> You that are true Believers, ought to walk in Church-fellowſhip, <hi>that you may be, and live under Church promiſes.</hi> You heard before, that there are many promiſes made and given to Churches, or to Believers in that capacity; which they cannot claim to themſelves, while they walk alone, as individuals and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to one another. God told <hi>Solomon,</hi> that his <hi>eyes and heart ſhould be perpetually in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.16. But <hi>David</hi>'s Gold, Silver, Braſs and other Materials, that he had provided to build it, had not ſuch a promiſe, until they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53333:154"/>were formed up into a houſe for God. So it is now with living or lively materials, that are hewn and polliſhed for to build him Goſpel-Temples. They may not expect the good of all the promiſes, but in the wayes of God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and their own duties. Although their being in Chriſt, united and married to him by faith, be the ground and foundation of their right to the promiſes, and all the good of them; yet the Great God gives out and imparts the Juice and fatneſs of them unto their Souls, in the wayes of his Goſpel precepts, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſuch as expect to be partakers of them, may ſeek all in thoſe wayes. I have in the <hi>laſt chapter</hi> inſtanced in ſeveral promiſes, that belong unto Churches, or unto Believers walking with God in that ſtate and capacity. As that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.12, 13, 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. the <hi>three laſt verſes,</hi> with ſeveral others of like import. Now then, if you will partake of the good of Church-promiſes, you muſt become holy and orderly Church-members. Surely, it is your duty to look after, and earneſtly to ſeek for them, and that where God hath promiſed, and you may find them. There you may obtain the milk and honey of the promiſes of <hi>Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> of making you <hi>fat and flouriſhing;</hi> of a <hi>bleſſed Miniſtry, and the bleſſings of it;</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine loves</hi> and <hi>ſweet proviſions,</hi> and of peace and ſecurity. I could have perſwaded you to joyn unto, and walk in the Churches of Chriſt, by other Reaſons; but I think theſe may ſuffice ſuch as are of willing hearts, and of meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſoft and holy ſpirits.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53333:154"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What ends ſhould all men aim at, and have in their eye, in joyning with and walking in Church-fellowſhip, or to what ends and purpoſes ſhould they become Church-members?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>To pleaſe and honour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> their Lord and King in his Churches, and to ſhew their Reſpect unto him, Obedience to his Commands, and declare their dependance on him for all things, and their ſubjection to him in all things. Chriſt the Lord hath done many good works to pleaſure them, exalt &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them; and therefore they ought to do his will and their duty, to pleaſe, exalt and honour him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 56.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. This glorious end every Church-member muſt have in his eye and heart in walking in Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To expreſs their high Reſentment of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to them, and their cordial thank fulneſs for them.</hi> They are greatly priviledged, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignified in the Churches by their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there, and they can no otherwiſe expreſs their gratitude to their head and King, but by accepting them, dutiful and faithful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to the ends for which they were given. Good men do ſhew how they value them by their accepting and uſing them. Churches and their priviledges are not ſmall matters in their accounts, or light matters in their eſteem, but they are high and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their hearts; and ſo are their works and duties there likewiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſhould aim at, and deſign <hi>to have and hold Communion with God, and Jeſus Chriſt the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53333:155"/>Lord. God is known in theſe Palaces,</hi> Pſal. 48.3. and to be ſeen in theſe <hi>Galleries.</hi> There he opens himſelf, and breaks opens the Treaſures of his love and grace unto his people, and there he ſtands holding out his <hi>Golden Scepter.</hi> There he waits to meet his Spouſes, to kiſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, to entertain and ſpeak friendly to them. <hi>He meeteth them that rejoyce and work Righteouſneſs, and remember him in his wayes,</hi> Eſa. 64.5. The wayes and walks of the Lord God are in his Churches: there he dwells, keeps houſe, manifeſts himſelf unto his Houſhold, and reſts himſelf, takes his delight, and ſhews forth his glory to them, and thither they ſhould go to meet him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Believers ſhould enter into, and walk with God in Church-fellowſhip, <hi>to encreaſe and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their grace, and to better their hearts, to grow in grace and in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. and that they may <hi>perfect holineſs in the fear of God;</hi> that they may <hi>receive of his fulneſs grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. <hi>and be filled with all the fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph. 3.19. that they may eat of their Fathers Bread and drink of his Wine, be made fat and flouriſhing, <hi>and fruitful in every good work,</hi> Pſal. 92. Pſal. 132. Col. 1.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>To keep their hearts warm, ſtrong and lively for God, his work and ſervice, and that they may obtain and enjoy all encouragements for, and in their works, tryals and difficulties.</hi> To fence and arm themſelves againſt all their Enemies aſſaults on them, and be enabled to fight againſt and conquer them in the Lord Jeſus. That they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53333:155"/>may be enabled to <hi>run their holy Race</hi> chearfully and couragiouſly, <hi>and finiſh their courſe with joy,</hi> Act. 20.24. 1 Cor. 9.24. Rom. 8. <hi>The Son of Righteouſneſs ſhines</hi> warmeſt on Believers Souls in the Churches of Chriſt, and there are more ſprings of joy and harveſts of profit, than are or can be found elſewhere. <hi>There is a River, the ſtreams whereof make glad the City of God: the holy place of the Tabernacles of the moſt high,</hi> Pſal. 46.4. There are no ſprings like the Churches ſprings, nor any harveſts like the Churches harveſts. The fulleſt, cleareſt and moſt fatning ſtreams of living waters flow from the fountain Chriſt on the Churches, and the moſt comely and fruitful branches are, or may be found in them. They may be the warmeſt, ſweeteſt, ſtrongeſt, livelieſt, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, fruitfulleſt, and the moſt ſpiritual men in the World. And that they may be ſuch, they ſhould joyn themſelves to, and walk in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they may adorn the Goſpel, convince the World, encourage their Brethren, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truths, Wayes, Authority and Headſhip of Chriſt. This is no ſmall thing, but they are all matters of the higheſt moments, and of greateſt concernment; and therefore, and for theſe ends they ſhould walk in Church-fellowſhip.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To augment and encreaſe your experiences, to obtain more acquaintance with your ſelves, the operations of the holy Ghoſt for you, and in you; and that you may be more clearly and firmly ſealed up to the day of Redemption.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To pay your vows and make good your
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53333:156"/>promiſes: to Perform your Covenant, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your work to God the Father and Chriſt your head. You owe them perſonal and Church-homage and ſervice: you are bound and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>obſerve and do all things, whatſoever your God commands and appoints you to obſerve and do,</hi> according to your opportunities and abilities: <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>ult. Joh.</hi> 14.15. which you do not, cannot do, unleſs you walk in ſome Church of Chriſt, and put your ſelves under all his Laws, Ordinances and Inſtitutions. But that you may ſo do, you put, or ought to put your ſelves under them, by joyning your ſelves to, and walking with God and his people in Church-fellowſhip. Theſe are ſome of the holy ends, all believers ſhould have in their eyes and hearts, in their aims and deſigns. They muſt take heed and beware of carnal ſelf-ends in this and all other matters of Religion, which will certainly croud in, and carry a great ſtroke in this matter. For the Lord Jeſus abhors them, and cannot endure to have his holy and ſpiritual matters and concernments ſubjected and made to ſerve mens carnal Intereſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will have no other aims and ends in Church-members hearts, but his own, whereby he may be glorified, and our Souls profited, and others encouraged to do their duty to him. We have no diſpenſation or allowance given us, to aim at and deſign to augment and encreaſe our Trades and worldly profits, or to be maintained by the Churches Benevolence, in and by our walking with them; or to greaten our names, and encreaſe our friendſhip and acquaintance among men: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be to capacitate us to do the more good
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53333:156"/>to men, to have larger opportunities to ſerve Chriſt, our Brethren and our own Souls. But our aims, ends and deſigns muſt be the Lord's, namely, to pleaſe and honour God, to expreſs our thankfulneſs to him for his love and grace to us, to hold and enjoy Communion with him, to grow in grace, and to be filled with all the fulneſs of God, to be warm, lively and ſtrong in our duties and performances, and for ſuch holy ends, as God requires. Thus you ſee that all Gods people are bound in duty to joyn themſelves to, and walk in ſpiritual fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Churches of Chriſt: as alſo for what ends, and to what purpoſe they ſhould do ſo.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Church-members <hi>muſt walk exemplarily:</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:53333:157"/>they ſhould be like ſo many <hi>Stars</hi> in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. They of all perſons in the world ought to be <hi>burning and ſhining lights.</hi> Their graces, gifts, words, deeds, and carriages ſhould ſhine ſo clear and bright, ſo gloriouſly and conſpicuouſly, as that they ſhould have the force and prevalency of Laws on the minds of beholders, ſo as that they may ſafely &amp; ſecurely imitate &amp; follow them. The Churches of Chriſt in the world, are as ſo many <hi>Sea-marks, Pilots,</hi> &amp; <hi>Guides,</hi> to Men; they live more in the glory of Heaven (as the Church is called in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.6.) &amp; in the beams of the glorious <hi>Son of Righteouſneſs</hi> than others do, and therefore they ſhould give better and clearer light, than others can.</p>
               <p>They are much more eyed, minded, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved than others are, and men expect, and look for more good in, and choice fruits from them, than they do from other men: They do, or may converſe more with Chriſt, and Chriſt with them, than other men do, and they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of greater things from him than other men are; and therefore they muſt be a ſingular People in all manner of holy Converſation and Godlineſs. Church-members are highly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and greatly priviledged; their holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion gives out, &amp; beſpeaks them to be a <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Treaſure</hi> unto God; and therefore they muſt declare before all men, that they are ſuch indeed, and not in pretence only. Their frames of heart, words, deeds, and deportments, muſt ſpeak for them, &amp; manifeſt them to be the ſame in Truth which they pretend to be. Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers words, works, and carriages, muſt <hi>praiſe them in the Gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhould be ſhining lights in Humility
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53333:157"/>and Meekneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on therefore as the Elect of God, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <hi>and be Cloathed with Humility,</hi> Phil. 2.3. <hi>But in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themſelves,</hi> Matth. 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt not be high, proud, and lofty; they may <hi>not think highly of themſelves,</hi> Rom. 12.3. nor cloath and deck themſelves as others do; They may not carry themſelves ſtrangely or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully towards men; but be meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards their Brethren, and all men in their Apparel, Words, Deeds, and Carriages; for if this part of Chriſt's Image do not appear in ſome good meaſure on them, they cannot have any at all. A meek ſpirit, carriage, and deportment is one of their Ornaments, <hi>It is in the ſight of God of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They muſt ſhine in Zeal &amp; Fervency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> this holy fire ſhould burn among them. They muſt not be of dull, ſtupid, heavy, and lumpiſh ſpirits; worſhip God, appear before him, and hold Communion one with another, indifferently, coldly, dully, regardleſly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, as if they were rather driven to their work and duty againſt their wills, than with their choyce, love, and deſire; but <hi>they muſt be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. for which ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11 and <hi>Phinchas,</hi> Numb. 25.11.13. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 69.9. To this they are redeemed, and for it they are purchaſed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. not only to do good works, but to be <hi>Zealous in and for them.</hi> The Lord Jeſus charges his Churches to be <hi>Zealous Churches,</hi> Rev. 3.19. in imitation of himſelf, whoſe Zeal
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53333:158"/>to God did <hi>eat him up,</hi> Joh. 2.17. Much holy Zeal governed and guided by much ſpiritual Wiſdom makes a man an excellent, ſhining, uſeful, acceptable, and deſirable man indeed. This ſhould be another of the Churches beauties and comely Ornaments, wherewith they ſhould ſtill be cloathed, decked, and adorned in this world. If this <hi>Diamond</hi> do not ſhine; if they are not adorned with this rare Jewel; what are they worth? and what are they good for? They will be like fire without heat and light, as to their duty, work, and uſefulneſs: They will be like <hi>Drones,</hi> or like Bees without ſtings, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of no conſiderable uſe in the world. All, that they do for God, Men, and their own Souls, will be of little or no eſteem and account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They muſt ſhine in Love and Charity too. Love is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> Col. 3.14. the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſinew, the cord and inſtrument that tyes us faſt to God, and to one another. <hi>See that ye love one another with pure hearts, fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 122. <hi>and let Love be without diſſimulation,</hi> Rom. 12.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ſoul, and ſtrength,</hi> Matth. 22.37. The internal motive, or moving cauſe of all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſervice to God, muſt be love to him and our duty. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. It is true that men cannot certainly diſcern this Love to God in one another, but God and our own Conſciences may, and muſt: Churches of Chriſt muſt be Churches of Love; they ſhould be acted and animated, drawn and conſtrained to every good work by Love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. All the ways and workings of Jeſus Chriſt to us, all that he doth to, or for us, is Love. Doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53333:158"/>us? or doth he correct us? it is all in, and from love. Love to us is the bottom, ſpring, and cauſe of all his diſpenſations towards us. His anger is provoked Love. Love ſhould knit our hearts faſt to our God and Head, to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſervices, and to one another in Church-fellowſhip. But of this already elſe-where.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Churches muſt ſhine in that great work and duty of Self-denyal,</hi> when need requires. <hi>He that will be my Diſciple</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Mark. 8.34. Matth. 16.24. Luk. 9.26. They ſhould be eminent and ſingular in Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, or in denying themſelves of many things for Chriſt, for their Brethren, and for their own ſouls ſakes. Their Lord Jeſus is the great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, pattern, and examplar of Self-denyal, and that for them, to ſerve them, and promote their happineſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and without this we <hi>cannot be his Diſciples.</hi> If we will not deny our ſelves for him and his people, he will not own us for his true Friends and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Churches muſt deny themſelves of (1.) Their <hi>worldly Buſineſſes and Intereſts,</hi> that they may wait on God, and celebrate his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of divine worſhip together. They muſt not be in their Shops, in the Fields, or about their worldly Buſineſſes and Recreations, when the Church meets to worſhip God. They may not, muſt not be about, and doing other things, when providence calls them to worſhip God: Neither may they ſtay at home to get the world, and ſerve themſelves, when they ſhould be in the Ordinances of God with their Brethren, ſerving God, and enriching their ſouls with his Spirit, Grace, and Truth. But then God calls
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53333:159"/>them to Self-denyal. (2.) They muſt deny themſelves to <hi>reprove and admoniſh Offenders,</hi> and adventure on their diſpleaſure in doing it. There are many difficulties in the way of this work within and without, and it will require Self-denyal to do it as we ought. Our hearts are averſe to it, our worldly intereſts are againſt it; for we may loſe a Friend as often as we do it to purpoſe. (3.) They muſt ſomtimes deny themſelves to <hi>help and relieve their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Eph. 4.28. The Rich to talk and hold friendly, and intimate converſe and communion with their Inferiors in gifts and worldly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. and others to ſupply the wants of the Poor and Needy, which they are bound to provide for. (4.) They muſt deny themſelves of the <hi>Garbs and Faſhions of the times</hi> and places wherein they live, when they may prove ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks unto the weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. They muſt not pleaſe themſelves only, <hi>but their Brethren,</hi> (with the denyal of themſelves) <hi>for their good to edification,</hi> Rom. 15.1, 2, 3. They muſt ſomtimes deny themſelves of their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, leſt the uſe of it prove a ſnare to others. (5.) They muſt deny themſelves ſomtimes <hi>of living up to the height and top of their Eſtates,</hi> eſpecially when they have riſen up from a low mean condition, to a high and rich condition; for their doing ſo is uſually very offenſive. (6.) They muſt ſomtimes deny their own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tempers and diſpoſitions</hi> alſo. There are ſome perſons very much diſpoſed to talk much in Company; they will have moſt, if not all the talk; they muſt (as they think) talk, and others muſt hear them; becauſe they have a greater
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53333:159"/>volubility, and fancy that they can expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better, and talk to better purpoſe than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can. But in this they ought to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to be (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19.) <hi>ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> eſpecially <hi>young Men and young Converts.</hi> 2. <hi>Women,</hi> eſpecially with and before men. 3. <hi>Inferiors</hi> with and before their Superiors; for their much ſpeaking to and before them, gives great offence. And here let me caution <hi>Wives</hi> to take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of that too much practiſed evil, namely, their too liberal and ſhameful talking before, or in the preſence of their <hi>Husbands:</hi> For although they think they do thereby lay open their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet their Auditors are ſatisfied, that they do too imperiouſly lay open their ſhame; and the like do other inferiors towards their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. So there are ſome Church-members who are naturally addicted to much <hi>Jeſting,</hi> and take much pleaſure therein: But they are called to, and commanded ſelf-denyal in this alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. They ought to be very ſober and ſerious, and to curb and reſtrain their natural bent, inclination and diſpoſition in this &amp; other matters. (7.) They muſt deny themſelves ſomtimes <hi>of their own juſt rights and dues,</hi> to avoyd ſcandal and reproach to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Jew, Gentile, and Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. They muſt not be too ſevere on ſuch as do them wrong, either by detaining from them their dues of money, or other things, eſpecially if they be poor, or much decayed in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.39, 40, 41. They muſt ſuffer wrong ſomtimes, yea, and that in many things, rather than ſtrive, contend, or diſpute; they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53333:160"/>muſt put up Injuries, and ſit down with loſs for the preventing of greater evils, to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their ſpirits, and manifeſt before all men, what their ſpecial grace can do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Churches muſt ſhine in <hi>Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation;</hi> they muſt <hi>learn in every ſtate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content,</hi> Phil. 4.11. and <hi>run their race with patience,</hi> Heb. 12.1. Church-members may not ſhew a murmuring diſquiet ſpirit, or a contentious quarrelling ſpirit any way, under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny providence whatſoever, <hi>Phil</hi> 2.14. but take all things well that God doth, either by his own, or the Creatures hands; thus did <hi>Job, Eli, Aaron, David, Paul,</hi> for which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have,</hi> Heb. 13.5. and <hi>with patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls; a meek and a quiet ſpirit is in the ſight of God of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. An impatient, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, murmuring, quarrelſome ſpirit, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hateful and abominable to God and Men. They are great ſcandals to men, and make the guilty perſons lothſome and undeſirable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this ſhould be another of the Churches Ornaments and Jewels, wherewith they ſhould be clothed, and wherein they ſhould ſhine in the world, and adorn their holy profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Church-members ſhould ſhine in <hi>Peace and Concord;</hi> they muſt be <hi>Peace-makers,</hi> not Peace-breakers, where, and with whom they live and converſe. They muſt not be <hi>Brawlers,</hi> or <hi>ſowers of diſcord,</hi> but be lovers of Peace, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Peace, and that with all men: Stirs and ſtrifes are moſt pernitious and hateful evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Church-members; they are the Devils
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53333:160"/>Seeds-men, and his Servants, to ſow his Seed for him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 19. Peace-breakers are common Plagues, and very ſcandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to all ſorts of men. Oh! how often doth the God of Peace, and Prince of Peace command and charge us <hi>to do the things that make for peace, to follow peace with all men, to be at peace among themſelves, and as much as in them is, to live peaceably with all men?</hi> They muſt be men of peaceable ſpirits, carriages, words, and deeds, that they may be bleſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.9. and becauſe God hath ſo commanded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. I have mentioned this before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the duties of Church-members to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But now I have a further aim, namely, to ſhew what ſpirits and practices ſhould be found in Church-members towards all men, but eſpecially towards their Fellow-members and their Relations with whom they live.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Church-members muſt ſhine in <hi>

Theya re indiſpenſibly bound to promote the welfare, holineſs, and happineſs of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Families, Relations, and all other Perſons ſo far as they can, and that zealouſly, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faithfully, and conſtantly. They are <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10, and they are ſet in the Church for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Churches ſhould ſhine <hi>in, and with cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and affable ſpirits, words, and carriages too.</hi> For they ſhould be like their Head, and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in this excellency alſo. Church-members muſt not be of harſh, ſowre, crabbed, &amp; churliſh ſpirits and behavior towards men, for that will render them odious and contemptible; but they muſt imitate and conform to the Lord Jeſus in a holy ſweetneſs, kindneſs, courteouſneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability towards Saints and Sinners, <hi>that they may adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt in all things,</hi> Tit. 2.10. 1 Pet. 3.8. A kind, courteous, and affable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and behaviour is a very comely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Garment for all ſuch to wear about them; for it commends their Perſons and Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and makes them exceeding lovely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and acceptable in all Societies; as alſo the good ways of God which they do profeſs to love, and in which they walk.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:53333:161"/>
               <p n="9">9. They ſhould ſhine with <hi>ſympathizing and forgiving ſpirits and practices.</hi> Their fallen Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or Neighbours, who have ſinned by wreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, may ſtand in need of their Pitty, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Sympathy; and then they ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it to them, and not be raſh and ſevere unto them. They muſt not lay on another load on their backs, &amp; purſue them with raſh Cenſures, ſhews of Cruelty and Vengeance in words or deeds, in wrath and diſpleaſure; but pitty them, pray for them, and give them the hand to raiſe them up again, and bring them to Conviction and Repentance, until they appear obſtinate and ſtubborn in their ſin. The <hi>Servant that took his fellow Servant by the throat, ſaying unto him, pay me my dues,</hi> is branded for a <hi>wicked man,</hi> Math. 18.28.35. It is ſuch a kind of cruelty as God abhors, and all holy men hate, and the world are ſtumbled at. Perſons, as ſoon as they ſin againſt us, or any way wrong us, are not preſently to be the objects of our Contempt and Cruelty, or of our Wrath &amp; Fury; no, but they ought to be the objects of our Pitty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, of our Sympathy and Aſſiſtance; and when they do ſeriouſly repent of any wrong they have done us, although they cannot make any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtitution or ſatisfaction, we ought to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give</hi> them, help, and comfort them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ult. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Math.</hi> 18 ult. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.10.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Churches ſhould ſhine <hi>in their orderly and dutiful Walkings in the Churches,</hi> as alſo in the Families where they live, and in, and towards their ſeveral Relations. Next to that myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and glorious Union and Relation, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord Jeſus and his people, that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53333:162"/>which is between his People in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Relation, is the neareſt and greateſt; becauſe (1.) It is a ſpiritual Relation and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Becauſe it is a Union and Relation on Chriſts account, and with reſpect to him as their Head and King. 3. Becauſe it is an everlaſting Union and Relation. Therefore in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Relation we ſhould be moſt preciſe and exact in our walkings, and performing all the duties of it. They muſt keep their places in the Church, and conſtantly attend unto all the duties therein. They ſhould never neglect their Church-meetings, excepting in extraordinary caſes, but be preſent at the Celebration of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip &amp; obſervation of all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt in the Church, and demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God and Men <hi>as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> They muſt endeavour ſo to walk in the Church, in their Families, among, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Relations, as that they may be blameleſs, <hi>giving no offence,</hi> Phil. 2.15, 16. Col. 2.5. 2 Cor. 6.3.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Church-members muſt ſhine in <hi>Diligence and Faithfulneſs.</hi> Slothfulneſs &amp; Unfaithfulneſs are ſcandalous ſins; but Diligence and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our truſts and buſineſſes, are Ornaments to our perſons and profeſſions, and to the Goſpel and Holy Name of Chriſt, which we do profeſs to love and believe. Church members are eyed and much obſerved, and therefore they had need <hi>walk circumſpectly,</hi> Eph. 5.15. and beg of God <hi>to lead them in plain paths,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> did) <hi>becauſe of their Enemies;</hi> as (or 'tis in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) thoſe which obſerve me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.11. They ſhould be diligent in their work and buſineſs,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53333:162"/>
                  <hi>and what their hands find to do, to do it with all their might,</hi> Eccle. 9.10. 2 Pet. 3.14. Heb. 6.12. And as they ſhould be diligent, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faithful and truſty to all that are concerned with them, ſo as to anſwer every ones reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expectation from them; they muſt be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true to one another in buying and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in borrowing and lending, in work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in counſel and friendſhip. Whatever Truſts they commit to one another, or is by any committed to them, they are indiſpenſibly bound to be as faithful and true to ſuch as to themſelves. They muſt <hi>render to all their Dues,</hi> Rom. 13.7, 8. and not in any thing <hi>purloyn,</hi> Tit. 2.10. Are they Buyers or Sellers, Lenders or Borrowers, or ſuch as are intruſted by any men in any thing? they muſt be faithful to their Truſts, or they will reproach the Lord Jeſus, ſcandalize men, and greatly diſhonour their Profeſſion. Theſe are ſome of the many good things, wherein they ſhould be as ſo many burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining Lights in the world, and in the Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>They muſt deſign, aim at, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute all the ends of God in appointing ſuch a ſtate and condition for them, their cleaving to, joyning with, and walking therein.</hi> God and they muſt joyn Iſſues and carry on the ſame ends and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. I have ſhewed you what ends perſons ſhould have in their eye, in joyning themſelves to the Churches of Chriſt; or in walking in Church-fellowſhip; and now I ſay, that in this State they muſt practically purſue them, and that with all poſſible diligence, ſeriouſneſs, and faithfulneſs. The Honour and Glory of God
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53333:163"/>the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt their Head and King, the happineſs and ſalvation of their own ſouls, are the two, or rather (as free grace hath laid it) the one great end of their ſo doing; for theſe ends are no more two, but one, and ſo to be believed and reſpected by us. This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral includes many particular and ſubordinate ends, which in purſuance and obtaining of the General, we muſt have in our eyes and hearts in our walking in this ſtate and relation. I ſhall not mention them here, but refer you to the next foregoing Chapter, where you may find ſeveral of them. Onely I ſhall add, that you muſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and unfainedly keep theſe and all other, Gods holy Ends, in your eyes and hearts, and purſue them with all your might, until you have obtained them to the higheſt degree you may. You muſt hold Communion together for theſe ends, and you muſt diſcourſe one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, hear the Word Preached, Pray, Sing, and receive the Lords Supper together for theſe ends. You muſt wreſtle with God in ſecret, quicken, and provoke one another, and prepare your hearts that you may ſo enjoy Ordinances, and worſhip God together, as to obtain them in the Houſe of God,</p>
               <p>Thirdly: <hi>Church-members muſt walk humbly with God,</hi> Micah 6.8. They muſt have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye againſt Heart-pride, and being great in their own eyes, becauſe of their greatr Pivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges &amp; high Dignities, their nearneſs to God, and the diſtinguiſhing Character that is upon them. All your <hi>glorying muſt be in God,</hi> not in your ſelves or Priviledges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. ult. for all you have is but lent you. A humble heart, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53333:163"/>lowly ſpirit, is a Jewel of great account in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To ſuch a perſon <hi>God looks with delight and complacency,</hi> Iſa. 66.2. To him <hi>he gives more grace, and fills his ſoul with good things,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. Luk. 1.53. The meek and humble-hearted <hi>he will teach,</hi> Pſal. 25.9. The lower any are in their own eyes, the higher is God there: The more humble-hearted any man is, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and glorious he is; the more like the moſt renowned Worthies in Scripture; yea, the more like Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. The more humble and lowly any man is, the more capable he is of Communion with God, and of being enriched with his Grace and Truth. If you indulge the Pride of your hearts, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Self-conceitedneſs in your ſelves, you will grieve the holy Spirit, and cauſe him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you. For as a humble heart gives God his due, ſo a proud heart robs him of it, and takes it. to himſelf. A humble heart is a growing, thriving, and profiting heart; it will make hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py earnings of all Gods Diſpenſations. He that is of a meek and humble ſpirit, is a gainer by all Providences, &amp; is bettered by all Occurrences: He gains by the Rod, and alſo by the Word; he gains by Loſſes, Croſſes, Tryals, Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Poverty, Reproaches; ſo likewiſe by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, Honour, Riches, and all other ſmiling Providences. If he looſe without, he gains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; therefore you ought <hi>to put on, as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, humbleneſs of mind towards God,</hi> 1 Col. 3.12. as well as humble carriages towards men, (as you heard before). For God loves to keep company with humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:53333:164"/>
               <p>Fourthly: <hi>Live by Faith on your God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on your Head and King;</hi> and expect (in the way of your duty and obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) all the fulneſs of Chriſt, and bleſſings of the Covenant. Do not give place to diſtruſts, doubts, and fears, or imagine that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you, or deny you that which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, becauſe of your perſonal unworthineſs. Conſider, that he hath called you into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and formed you into holy Corporations, put you under his Ordinances, and made you his Houſholds, brought you into Order, and ſet you near unto himſelf, that he might viſit you and walk with you, that he might impart his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to you, diſtribute his Covenant-favours to your ſouls, perform his Promiſes, <hi>and fill you with all the fulneſs of himſelf:</hi> Therefore do you hang about him, and cleave to him, <hi>for he is faithful that hath promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10.23. <hi>and is able to perform all his Promiſes,</hi> Rom. 4.21. yea, and he is <hi>moſt freely willing</hi> to do it alſo, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. ult. Remember that God hath not brought you into his Houſe to famiſh you, or deal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with you: No, but to nouriſh and feed you, to ſtrengthen and ſanctifie you, to comfort and refreſh you, to teach you, build you up, care for you, and prepare you for eternal life. <hi>God is ever mindful of his Covenant;</hi> therefore do you remember to make him your ſtay and truſt, live upon him, and expect all promiſed good from him; He would have you do ſo, he hath commanded it, and therefore do it in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3.5.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. His hand and heart will be open to you, and from his Fountain of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53333:164"/>Love &amp; Graces <hi>ſhall flow Rivers of living waters</hi> into your ſouls, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. He will always care for, and <hi>watch over you for good; he will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you every moment; he will keep you night and day,</hi> Iſa. 27. 3. Oh! then truſt in him at all times, and <hi>in all your ways acknowledge him,</hi> and he will not fail <hi>to direct your ſteps,</hi> Prov. 3.6. <hi>caſt all your care on him, for he careth for you, and the peace of God ſhall keep you,</hi> Phil. 4. Expect, and look for your purchaſed and promiſed por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in your Fathers Houſe, in walking in his Family-order, and under the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, under the Laws and inſpection of the great and gracious Lord thereof. In all your waitings on him in every Ordinance of his, be ſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, hope, and wait for his Preſence and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. When-ever you aſcend the Mountain of the Lords Houſe, to meet the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to preſent your King with a Thank-offering, be ſure to carry Faith with you, go with much Faith and Hope unto him, and do as Children do, whilſt in their Fathers Houſe; they live on their Father for Food, Raiment, and all other bodily ſupplys. So do you in your Fathers ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Houſe, live on him for all proviſions, mind your duty, and truſt him with your promiſed all.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: <hi>Let your Praiſe wait for your God and King in</hi> Zion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.1. and do not neglect to go up to his Temples with your Sacrifices, when the <hi>Tribes</hi> go, or are called up thither; then, I ſay, do you be ſure to go up with them; ſtay not behind, nor tarry at home, when others go up; go with your Brethren when they go, that it may be ſaid, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. <hi>Every one</hi> (namely,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53333:165"/>of the Church) <hi>appeareth before God in</hi> Zion; and be ſure that when you go, you go not <hi>empty-handed,</hi> Exod. 23.15. Exod. 34.20. If you cannot preſent your King with a Lamb for a Thank-offering, carry him two Turtle Doves with you; if not able to carry two Doves, then carry with thee <hi>two Mites,</hi> as the Widdow, the poor Widdow did, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.42, 43, 44. But if thou haſt not two Mites to carry with thee, to preſent to thy God for a Free-will or Thank-offering, then go abegging to him for one; but in any wiſe go to your Church-meetings with your Brethren, tarry not behind them: For if you do neglect to do ſo, you rob God, break your Covenant, offend your Brethren, and wrong your own ſouls. You muſt go up, becauſe you are called to go, and that you may meet God in <hi>Zion,</hi> and receive his bleſſings, <hi>for there he commands them,</hi> Pſal. 133. ult. Oh! it is ſad indeed, when perſons ſhall pretend to enter into Churches, take upon them the obſervation of all the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt there, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and publickly promiſe and engage to walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of God with his people, and yet ſhall dare wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to neglect their place and duty therein, and to pay their Vows to their God and King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.5.8. Such as are good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Families and Corporations will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mind if all within them do anſwer to their calls, and perform their duties, when called ſo to do. So doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, He ſummons them by his Miniſters to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him, wait on, and worſhip him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bring him a Church-offering and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53333:165"/>ſervice, and narrowly obſerves who comes, and who neglects it; how thy come, and with what frames of hearts, &amp; to what ends, as the 2. &amp; 3. Chap of <hi>Rev.</hi> ſhew. And if he find any wanting that might come, or ſee them come careleſly and ſuperficially, he accounts himſelf ſlighted &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, and his Love and Grace contemned and undervalued. God expects that you ſhould be conſtant in Church-meetings, and not decline them at any time, but when his hand obſtructs and impedes you; but that there you ſhould come with your Free-will offerings, and do your Duty &amp; Homage to him, as he commanded you. Believe it, this is a matter of great moment, and not to be ſlighted or diſregarded by you.</p>
               <p>Sixthly: <hi>You muſt walk with God in Church-fellowſhip, in Sincerity, and with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs of heart to.</hi> Without this, all your performances are in vain. The Lord Jeſus is very curious and critical in <hi>ſearching your hearts</hi> in your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know that I ſearch the reins and the heart.</hi> And in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. ſaith God to the inchurched Jews, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins.</hi> Then ſurely it muſt very much concern you to ſee, that <hi>you draw night to God</hi> (continually) <hi>with true hearts,</hi> Heb. 10.22. and that without all allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Guile and Hypocriſie. <hi>A little of this Leaven will quickly leaven the whole lump of duties,</hi> Gal. 5.9. It will ſo corrupt and ſowre them, as that they will be all ſtark naught, and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to kindle and encreaſe the flames of God's Wrath and Vengeance againſt you. Therefore take heed and beware of Hypocriſie, and do not connive or wink at the leaſt grain of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53333:166"/>it in your hearts or duties, but be ſure to walk with God in the performance of all duties, in Integrity and Uprightneſs: Be ſure, that your God expects it from you, and requires it of you, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.14. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro through-out the Churches, to ſee whoſe heart is perfect with him,</hi> and whoſe is hypocritical, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>He requires Truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. and that all Church-members ſhould walk before him in Truth, and with perfect hearts, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.3. You muſt worſhip God, and ſerve him with your <hi>all,</hi> for your little all is but too little for him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. You muſt not leave one hoof behind, when you do any thing for God, nor put God off with a part of your abilities for the whole; for if you do, you will loſe the acceptance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all: <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy Name</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) Pſal. 103.1.</p>
               <p>Seventhly: See that you worſhip God, and obſerve all his Ordinances in the Church, <hi>in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or ſpiritually.</hi> Remember that you are his holy ſpiritual Temples, the Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. that all the Ordinances of worſhip in them are holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ordinances ſtampt with the Image of God's Holineſs and Authority; and that <hi>he will be worſhipped in ſpirit,</hi> or ſpiritually, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. You muſt be very careful that you take not up with the external part and outſide of your duties and priviledges, that you ſettle not your ſelves and ſtay (as it were) in, and upon Ordinances, and your enjoying and obſerving
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53333:166"/>them; but <hi>get within the Vail,</hi> ſeek and look for God and Chriſt, for Heaven and glorious things in them. Let your Faith conduct you by the hand of the Spirit into the boſom and heart of Chriſt, that there you may read his Love, Grace, and glorious Excellencies, have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and cloſe Communion with him, and be raviſhed and refreſhed with his Perſon and Love. Get into his <hi>Galleries,</hi> and ſee the King of Glory in his beautys and tranſcendant ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and get into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> into the moſt holy place; for the way is opened, and the vail drawn off and removed by your Head, for you to come and meet him there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore do not ſtand and worſhip in the outer Court of the Temple, but go and paſs through Ordinances to Chriſt <hi>into the holieſt of all;</hi> and when-ever you go and enter in, be you ſure that you carry all Graces &amp; the Spirit with you, to meet your Lord, and honour him with them. Endeavour all you can to ſee and feel him, to get your hearts raviſhed with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Love, that thereby they may be raiſed up to great delight, joy, chearfulneſs, adoration, admiration and praiſe, that they may be filled with his Savours, warmed with his Love, drawn by his Beauty, be (by all) knit and united, tyed and bound faſt to him. Then we worſhip him in ſpirit, or ſpiritually, when we worſhip him, &amp; go to meet him with all our Graces in the Holy of Holies, &amp; when our Hearts &amp; Graces do cloſe up with, and hold Communion with him in theſe <hi>Beauties of Holineſs,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. I am affraid that very few Church-members are experimentally acquainted with this matter;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53333:167"/>for if they were ſo acquainted with it indeed, they could not do as they do. They could not neglect the worſhip and Ordinances of Chriſt, nor cry up a <hi>Cephas,</hi> and cry down a <hi>Paul,</hi> as they do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. They could not be ſo careleſs and formal in them as they are, nor carry about ſuch dead, lumpiſh, and heavy hearts and minds as they do. Well, but however it hath been with you, let it be ſo no more: Do you for time to come learn ſo to worſhip God, as you have heard, that ſo you may pleaſe and honour him, and he may delight to meet with, and bleſs you.</p>
               <p>Eightly: You muſt walk in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>chearfully, comfortably,</hi> and <hi>joyfully.</hi> You muſt not be <hi>Whiners</hi> and <hi>Complainers;</hi> you muſt not be ſad, lumpiſh, and melancholly in your Father's Houſe: No, for that will greatly reflect on your Father, and on your Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. You will raiſe ſuſpicions in the minds of men on the good ways of God, and in a ſenſe you will contradict his Goſpel, his Truth, and Faithfulneſs, his Love and Care to and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Churches. For God hath promiſed to <hi>make his People joyful in his Houſe of Prayer,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. <hi>and to ſatisfie them with Bread,</hi> Pſal. 132.15. But by the ſad and heavy walkings of his People in his Houſe, they declare that they are not ſatisfied, nor find ſuch Proviſions in his Houſe as he promiſed, and they expected. Such ſad, lumpiſh, and melancholly Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do greatly diſhonour Chriſt and his good ways, offend their Brethren and ſcandalize the World. For when they ſee them walk ſo, what will they think and ſay of the waies and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53333:167"/>of God? will they not falſely accuſe and condemn them, deſpiſe and loath them, yea and harden their hearts againſt Religion it ſelf? or elſe they will judge and cenſure ſuch for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and Diſſemblers. We ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Religion and the good wayes of God, wherein we walk, to the Conviction and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of all that behold us: and that in one thing or way, as well as another. We ſhould walk with a holy, ſerious, chearfulneſs, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and be joyful, chearful and pleaſant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and towards all men; and that for Chriſt's, Religion's, our own and others ſakes; that by this carriage we may honour God, commend his Goſpel-Religion, and holy wayes, his eaſy, ſweet and pleaſant yoke and wayes: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. Prov.</hi> 3.17. encourage and ſtrengthen the hearts and hands of our Brethren; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of the Goodneſs; Pleaſantneſs and Profit of them, and perſwade them to fall in love with and imbrace them. You muſt ſo walk alſo, becauſe God hath inchurched you, and put you under his Ordinances, and promiſed to make you joyful, pleaſant and chearful: yea he charges and commands you to be and do ſo, <hi>Phil</hi> 3.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>ult.</hi> Remember, and lay to heart, how many Cauſes &amp; Objects you have to make you chearful, pleaſant and joyful. Therefore make uſe of them, for the enabling you to walk joyfully.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the Evils, Sins and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that Church-members are Subject to? pray ſhew us them, that we may know and avoid them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:53333:168"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Church-members are ſubject or lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many Evils, Sins and Temptations in their Church-ſtate. For Believers being form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up together in one body, profeſs to be one, and to be entirely concerned and included with and in one another, &amp; ſo are ſaid <hi>to be one Lump;</hi> Gal. 5.9. and one Houſe or Temple. The Devil doth ſet on them the more furiouſly, and with greater ſtrength and diligence, that ſo he may wound and miſchief many with his fiery Darts together, and kill a whole Church by ſtabbing one or two Members thereof. For he knows that if he can tempt one to ſin openly and ſcandalouſly, he may thereby reproach the whole body, and put them to grief and ſhame. For a <hi>little Leaven, leavens the whole Lump,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.6. Gal. 5.9. Therefore, I ſay, he will be more buſy with Church-members, than with others in this matter: which ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke them to arm the more carefully, watch the more diligently, and fight the more manfully, that they be not deluded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by him, to the grief and ſhame of their Fellow-members. It is true, that Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have more helps and advantages againſt Sin and Temptation, than others have, as I have elſewhere ſhewed; and it is as true, that they ſhall be moſtly aſſaulted and tryed; and yet (if they will) they are and will be on the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ground againſt all theſe Evils: as they will find by experience, if they will mind their duty; I will name a few of the Evils they will be tempted to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To take up and entertain <hi>evil Surmiſals of one another,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 1 Tim. 6.4. They will
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53333:168"/>be greatly tempted to keep groundleſs Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Suſpicions one of another, which tends and leads to</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Harſh and ſevere Cenſurings, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Judgings one of another,</hi> which is a moſt hateful ſin in the ſight of God, and which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden and condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10, 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They will be tempted to <hi>Envy</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is one of the deviliſh ſins ſo often mentioned and condemned in the Scripture, and frequently forbidden, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. They will be tempted to be envious at that in their Brethren, for which they ought to thank God and rejoyce, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. They muſt not envy the proſperity of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much leſs that of their Brethren, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1. Enviers eyes are evil, becauſe God is good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. here you have the Pourtraiture and expreſs Image of Envy, and of an envious Perſon, what draws it forth, or what is the Object of their Envy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They will be tempted to be <hi>proud and lifted up</hi> with their Church-ſtate, with the Priviledges and Dignity thereof: to think highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; vilely of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. They are very ſubject to be lifted up with their Gifts and Attainments, and to affect vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and to be too great in their own eyes: which is a moſt hateful, and pernitious Evil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They will be tempted to <hi>Wrath, Strife, and Schiſms;</hi> to cauſe and raiſe Diviſions, Debates, Contentions and Diſputings: which is a real
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53333:169"/>fruit of Pride, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4, 5. and very pernicious to the glory, welfare and comfort of the Church. And although this Evil be expreſly forbidden and greatly condemned, yet many Church-members can too boldly and confidently practiſe it, and pretend that they have reaſon or cauſe ſo to do: yea, and that they do well in it. But take heed and beware of it: and let ſuch know, that it is a moſt hateful and deviliſh Sin, and a moſt infectious Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that will deſtroy the Authours and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it, if not timely repented of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They will be tempted to <hi>Formality, and taking up with the form of Godlineſs without the power thereof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. To take up with, and ſettle themſelves on the Lees of Ordinances and external Duties and Enjoyments, with the neglect of the Heart, Soul, Life and Power of them; and heart-warming, heart-ſanctifying, and heart-teaching Communion with God. Oh! how many Church-members are there, who do indulge themſelves, comply with the natural Genius of their own hearts, and joyn iſſues with Satan in this matter? who eye not, nor look moſtly unto the Spirit, Chriſt, Grace and good of the means they uſe, nor bring their hearts and graces to God in them; but reſt and ſatisfy themſelves with a cold, ſapleſs, and lifeleſs form, or out-ſide of Religion; and therefore they do not, cannot thrive and proſper: but they wither and decay within, while they are in the Courts of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They will be tempted to the great ſin and evil, of <hi>Reproaching and Back-biting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> to vilifie, defame and ſpeak evil one of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53333:169"/>another, and blaſt each others good Names and Reputations. This is another miſchievous and abominable Sin, which is found too rife and rampant amongſt them. It is a moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Evil and prejudicial to Chriſt himſelf, his Goſpel, People, Wayes and Intereſts; and therefore Satan will ſtrive the more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to provoke them to do it; and therefore we ſhould be the more watchful againſt it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. God abhors this Tongue-ſin, this poyſonous Sword, and good-name-Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Abomination: he cannot bear to hear his Church-members to be <hi>biting and devouring one another,</hi> Gal. 5.15. yet are they prone and often tempted to it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They will be tempted to <hi>ſlight, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;</hi> yea, and <hi>to deſpiſe one another;</hi> eſpecially, ſuch as are poor and weak; they will be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſlight and diſeſteem ſuch as are high and honourable in God's account, and ſuch as he greatly values and eſteems. But take heed and beware of it; for it is a moſt God-provoking ſin. They are glorious in Gods thoughts, let them not be baſe in yours. Their names are pretious in Heaven, and let them be pretious to you.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They will be tempted to <hi>ſlight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their priviledges, and to diſregard their works and duties in the Church.</hi> At firſt they are much taken and affected with them, but after a while they do as much ſlight and diſeſteem them; neglect and diſregard them: and then they fall to omitting and neglecting them. Theſe are dear-bought priviledges and duties,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53333:170"/>and therefore ought to be highly accounted of and eſteemed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And then it follows, that they will <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with their Teachers, or be much offended at them;</hi> ſlight and diſeſteem them, and be full of objections againſt them and their works. But you muſt take heed and beware of this evil likewiſe; for when you have forſaken God, and he hath left you, then you are tempted to diſlike your Teachers, but never till then. They are Chriſt's <hi>Embaſſadors, Jewels and Inſtruments of his glory,</hi> in the Churches and in the World, and they are near and dear to him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſin will be very great in ſlighting and diſeſteeming them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They will be tempted to <hi>leave communion with the Church,</hi> and ramble about from place to place, which is a dangerous and pernicious evil, and tends directly to the breaking of the Churches, and deſtruction of all Church-order. Many love to change their Place, Works and Company; and ſeem to be better every, or any where, than in their own Place and Work.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They will be tempted <hi>to neglect their Church-duties one to another,</hi> and live as perſons alone, without having regard of, or reſpect unto one another as Brethren and Members of the ſame houſhold. And when they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Temptation into their minds, they will eaſily diſpenſe with total Omiſſions, and not be troubled at it, nor care what becomes of one another.</p>
               <p n="14">14. They will be tempted <hi>to draw nigh to God in Church-Ordinances, with worldly, vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared hearts.</hi> The Commoneſs of them, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53333:170"/>their frequent uſe of them, together with the untunedneſs of their hearts, make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things and matters to them: ſo as that they dare adventure on them with common frames of heart, which once they durſt not do: But now they can diſpenſe with it, as with ſome light matter.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They will be tempted <hi>to receive pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines,</hi> and to entertain evil Opinions, in, and about Religion. Many Church-members have been caught in theſe Nets, and taken in theſe Snares: not becauſe they were ſuch, but becauſe they walked not warily and circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſtate and relation. For by being Church-members, they have had great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt them, and means to prevent their being enſnared, but that they improved them not, as they might have done, for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. They were not aware of him, who goes up and down in the Kingdom to ſow his Tares.</p>
               <p n="16">16. They will be tempted, when they have ſuckt in any poyſonous Doctrines, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained erronious Opinions, <hi>to help the Devil in ſowing them in the minds of others,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to leaven them with their new Leaven alſo. For being deluded and ſeduced themſelves, it is almoſt natural to them to ſeduce others likewiſe; as experience teſtifies.</p>
               <p n="17">17. They will be tempted <hi>to prejudice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure each others Souls, in their occaſional Viſits,</hi> by entertaining one another with vain, frothy and heart-deadning Diſcourſes, inſtead of heart bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Diſcourſes. They will be tempted to tempt one another to give and receive ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53333:171"/>as tends to the ſubverting and corrupting of each others Souls, drawing them away from God, and indiſpoſing them for their duties, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to edification and profit. And this is a moſt pernitious Evil, though little minded and conſidered: and it is an Evil that is much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and countenanced amongſt Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For they that have ſuch opportunities, which they ought to improve for the better and not for the worſe, are found improving them by their Tongues and Ears for the worſe and not for the better, which will coſt them very dear hereafter. Such carnal and vain Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as are frequently found among them, corrupt good Hearts, and Manners alſo.</p>
               <p n="18">18. They will be tempted <hi>to be ungrateful to God for his mercies to them,</hi> and to <hi>account their duty and priviledges, their heavy Yoke &amp; Burdens,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did their Deliverance from their Bondage in <hi>Egypt.</hi> They were diſpleaſed with God and <hi>Moſes</hi> for bringing them out of their houſe of Bondage, and it is to be feared that ſome Church-members now are diſpleaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are brought into the Houſe of God: and they ſay in their hearts would God we had been wiſer, than to have joyned our ſelves to the Churches; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid, would God that we had dyed in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Take heed of this evil. We are ſo encumbred with Meetings, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements, and with one thing and another, as that our condition is burdenſome unto us, is the language of ſome, as I have ground to think.</p>
               <p n="19">19. They will be tempted <hi>to ſtacken their zeal, care and diligence, to grow in grace and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs,</hi> and to look after their gettings in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53333:171"/>the Churches and Ordinances of Chriſt. So that they will grow lukewarm, careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, what becomes of their Souls: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thrive and proſper, or whether they do wither and decay: whether they partake of the fatneſs of God's houſe or no.</p>
               <p n="20">20. They will be tempted <hi>to make carnal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to themſelves, of their Church-ſtate,</hi> and to aim at, and proſecute worldly Ends therein, more than ſpiritual, and to ſubordinate and make uſe of their work and duty there, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and ſerve a baſe worldly Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="21">21. They will be tempted <hi>to deſert their duty, and relinquiſh their Station and Priviledges in a trying time;</hi> and to conform to the world, for filthy Lucre's ſake, and to enjoy their outward Peace and Liberty. Many ſeem to be ſtrong and well ſettled in their faith, principles and practiſe before the Tempeſt blows in their faces; but when the Wind and Waves beat againſt them, they appear other kind of men. Therefore, <hi>let him that ſtandeth</hi> in a calm day, <hi>take heed that he fall not in</hi> a ſtormy night. Theſe are ſome of the Evils and Sins, that you will be tempted to in your Church-ſtate. Therefore conſider them, and make ſufficient and ſeaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions againſt them: leſt they take you una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and overthrow you.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But ſome may ſay, if all theſe Evils and Dangers uttend Church-members, then it is better for us to keep out of it, and not be Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that we may avoid them, and not expoſe our ſelves to Sin and Temptation therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſuch Temptations will attend Church-members, is certain; but that therefore
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53333:172"/>Believers ſhould keep out of a Church-ſtate, that I deny. For 1. It is your indiſpenſible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (as you have heard) to walk in Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip; and therefore you muſt do ſo: and it being your duty, you may be ſure it is the ſafeſt and the moſt ſecure way for you, to keep you from Sin and prevalent Temptations to it. For the way of our duty, is ever the ſureſt and ſafeſt way, as we all know.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What I have ſaid in this matter, is <hi>cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;</hi> not to affright any from their duty and priviledges; but to quicken and provoke Church-members to the more wiſe, watchful and exact walkings; to more Diligence and Faithfulneſs, in making proviſions againſt them, that they may be ready armed and fenced againſt them, to reſiſt and conquer them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although you may be more tempted to ſin in a Church-ſtate, yet you may ſin leſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than out of it. For you have heard already, that a true Church of Chriſt is inveſted with many priviledges and advantages againſt Sin, and Temptations to it: which if well uſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by you, they will ſufficiently defend you, and ballance all the weights that may be put into the ballance of Temptations, and abundantly ſtore you with proviſions againſt them, were they a thouſand times as many more. For you have heard, that in a Church there is more of Chriſt, and of his Spirit and Grace for Believers, than out of ſuch a State and Relation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much better and ſafer being there, and walking with God therein, than to be elſewhere. Wherefore let all Church-members <hi>ſee that they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53333:172"/>walk circumſpectly,</hi> or (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) exactly, cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and accurately, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. in their Church-ſtate and Relation. Mind and practiſe what you ſee (before) you are bound to do; and take heed that you ſo walk and demean your ſelves towards God, Men and your own Souls; that you carefully watch againſt and avoid all the aforeſaid Evils, and the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that lead you to them. And to move and quicken you ſo to do, be pleaſed to conſider and lay to heart theſe few Conſiderations,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in a Church-ſtate you have <hi>many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers.</hi> There are <hi>many eyes on you,</hi> and many that watch for your halting. The world knows that you have ſeparated from them upon the account of holineſs, and that by grace you are made better than they. They know that you pretend to ſingular things, and that you profeſs to be called out of the World, and from ſin to holineſs and ſingular Righteouſneſs, and that you left Communion with them on a Religious account. They underſtand that you pretend to more light and knowledge, to more communion with God, and to greater attainments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments than they do: and therefore expect to ſee better things from you, than from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuch as they are. They will tell you, <hi>that to whom much is given, of them much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> and that you are in your profeſſion, ſome of them. They will tell you, that they can no otherwiſe judge of you, than by your fruits, and if they be not ſuitable to your profeſſion and pretences, they will think you are but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and painted Sepulchres. Be ſure that you have many, that mind and ſtrictly obſerve all your ſteps.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:53333:173"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Your Lord and King expects ſingular and peculiar frames of hearts, words &amp; deeds from you.</hi> He narrowly marks your ſteps, and obſerves your walkings, how you carry your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, how you walk towards and before all men, and what your frames and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments are towards himſelf. <hi>For his eyes behold, and his eye-lids try the Children of men.</hi> Pſal. 11.4. You know, and he tells you, that he hath done great and ſpecial things for you; that he hath been at great expence of blood and treaſure on you; and all to make you a <hi>peculiar People unto himſelf.</hi> Tit. 2.14. He hath honoured and exalted you, and <hi>brought you nigh unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and entruſted you with <hi>great Talents.</hi> He hath ſet you on high, and magnified you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in the ſight of all ſorts of men, and hath made you his <hi>golden Candleſticks,</hi> Rev. 2.1. and his living Witneſſes; and therefore he may well expect and require ſpecial carriages, and ſingular fruits from you. Oh! then do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him of his ſo reaſonable expectations; but let the Lord Jeſus ſee in you the fruits of his labour and toyl, of his coſt and charge, and of his blood and travel. Let him find you <hi>good Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> of his houſe, and houſhold-affairs, and meet to be truſted with more of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, <hi>that your Brethren and Fellow-members,</hi> and eſpecially, <hi>your Teachers and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> do expect ſuch walkings, fruits and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages from you. Your Teachers expect it, earneſtly deſire it, pray for it, and labour to make you ſuch. Your Fellow-members they alſo look for it, pray for it, and earneſtly deſire
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53333:173"/>it: I mean ſuch of them as are holy ſpiritual perſons They, eſpecially your <hi>Teachers,</hi> do long, and are in travail for it; and they greatly rejoyce (indeed) to ſee you a holy, humble, wiſe, zealous, meek, diligent, faithful, loving, and a fruit-bearing people. They are exceedingly troubled to ſee their labour to be in vain with, and to you: Your non-proficiency, cold, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and carnal walkings; your barrenneſs and unprofitableneſs; your want of love to God, your own ſouls, and to one another are great, very great, and heart-breaking afflictions to them.

               <p n="4">4. Conſider, <hi>that your own ſouls are greatly concerned in theſe things:</hi> If you walk in theſe ways, practiſe the aforeſaid duties, to obſerve theſe ſaid Ordinances of divine worſhip, and carefully watch againſt, and avoyd the ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and temptations to ſin, that your ſouls and bodys will reap the benefit and profit of all. You will have the peace, joy, ſatisfaction, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſolation of your ſo doing. But if on the contrary, you be found negligent and careleſs of the holy will of God, and your duties, and diſobedient unto his holy Laws: If you ſlight and undervalue your great and invaluable priviledges and enjoyments, and make not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual earnings of them, but remain dead, cold, barren, and unfruitful under them; connive at,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53333:174"/>and indulge any of the ſaid Sins, or others like them, and dally with Temptations; you will certainly rue for it, and pull on your heads and hearts many evils, troubles, ſorrows, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietments; many fears and diſtreſſes, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances and confuſions. You will drive God from you, cauſe him to ſhut up his loving Countenance from you in diſpleaſure, and to write bitter things againſt you. Your own ſouls are very much concerned in your exact, holy, diligent, faithful, and circumſpect walking with God in all his ways and Goſpel-precepts in your Church-ſtate. Therefore do you aim at, and ſeek their good, and do you ſo walk and carry your ſelves towards God and one another as to promote their happineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, <hi>call to mind, and lay to heart the ends for which you joyned your ſelves to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, as alſo the ſolemn profeſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement you then made to, and before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men.</hi> Remember, that they are all Witneſſes for you, to what you did, when you entred in among them, and took on you the ſerious, diligent, faithful, and conſtant obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Laws and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt in them, when you took hold of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, owned the Lord Chriſt for your Head, King, and Law-giver, and promiſed to yield him all faithful ſubjection and obedience. For if you forget theſe things, neglect your duties, or walk contrary unto God; know for certain that he will remember all, and will teſtifie againſt you; yea, he will make your own Conſciences Witneſſes againſt you. Oh conſider! did you not joyn in Church-fellowſhip, that you might

Ask your Hearts and Conſciences, did we not joyn our ſelves together in a holy band, and bind our ſelves to <hi>walk with God unto all well-pleaſing,</hi> in our Church-ſtate and Goſpel-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to another? ſurely we did. Well then, do we now (indeed) keep theſe things warm on our hearts, aim at, and proſecute them in good earneſt, or do we not? Did we not aim at, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and engage to get more Acquaintance and Communion with Chriſt, &amp; more Acquaintance with our ſelves, and with the Laws, Waies and Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt? and did we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and promiſe to obey him, wait on him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorifie him in and by our ſo doing? Did we not intend and aim at the profit of our own ſouls, the good of one another, and of all men, and that we might be made fruitful in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. That Luſts might be mortified, Sin ſubdued, Grace magnified, and our Hearts cleanſed and purified?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider and lay to heart <hi>the many and great encouragements you have to further you,</hi> to ſtrengthen your hands and animate your hearts to your duty, and ſo walking in your Church-fellowſhip.

O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how great things the Lord hath done for you, that you might be his People, and walk as you have heard. When you were accurſed and

He found you blind, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned you; fallen, and he lifted you up. You were weak, and he ſtrengthned you; in pain, and he eaſed you; ſorrowful, and he comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you: When you were wandring out of the way of peace and happineſs, he ſought you out, and brought you back unto himſelf; he ſet your feet in the right way, and ſpake peace unto you. Ever ſince you were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, he hath ſuccoured, ſupported, ſupplied, and cared for you.

It is a Feaſt, yea, it is a <hi>Feaſt of fat things,</hi> Iſa. 25.6. and a Heavenly <hi>Banquet,</hi> Cant. 2.4. It is the Spiritual Wedding-Supper, made &amp; appointed by Jeſus Chriſt for his Spouſes; where he comes, furniſhes the Table, ſits down and eats with them; invites them to ſit down with him, and bids them welcome; bids them <hi>eat and drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,</hi> Rev. 3.20. Cant. 5.1. (2) It is a <hi>Spiritual Goſpel-Ordinance,</hi> not a Civil, or a Carnal and Legal Ordinance ſuch as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the Jewiſh Church of old; but it is a Spiritual Goſpel-Ordinance, for, and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual things. (3.) The <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> of it, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, him to whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had <hi>committed all power. and Authority,</hi> and into whoſe hand he had <hi>given all things,</hi> Joh. 3.35. Matth 11.27. Matth. 28.18. I ſay, it is an Ordinance inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>For I received of the Lord that, which alſo I delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do ye in remembrance of me.</hi> And mark it, it is an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and a poſitive Ordinance and duty, not a natural or moral one. It is not founded on, or put in, and among the moral precepts, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws of God; but it is meerly an Inſtitution of Chriſt, appointed for, and given to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched members, and none elſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not an Ordinance for, and the uſe of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53333:176"/>it, a duty incumbent on Unbelievers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dead in ſins, while they remain in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but 'tis only appointed and intended for Believers in their orderly walkings with God. All men, as they are reaſonable Creatures, are bound to pray to God, and to hear his Word preached, becauſe they are (though not meerly and only ſo) Ordinances and duties of moral worſhip, and not meerly of divine Inſtitution, as Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are; but all men are not ſo bound to participate of the Lords Supper and water Baptiſm. (4.) It is ſaid, that this Ordinance is appointed for, and given to inchurched Saints, that is, that perſons in Chriſt, may, and they only can partake of it in the way and order of the Goſpel. For although their relation to Chriſt, and intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, gives them a fundamental right unto it, yet it is their orderly walking together in Church-fellowſhip under the diſcipline of Chriſt, the care, inſpection, and government of his Church-Miniſters, that gives them an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and orderly right unto it. For we never read of any of the Apoſtles, or other Miniſters in their days, that did, or were allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, but ſuch as were inchurched. That it was by the Apoſtles direction adminiſtred and received in the Churches we often find, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that it was ſo elſe-where, or by Believers out of a Church-ſtate, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. ult. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 2. And <hi>Paul</hi> tell, the Church at <hi>Corinth, That the Cup of Bleſſing, which we bleſs, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Blood of Chriſt? the Bread, that we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53333:177"/>Chriſt? For we being many are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. (5.) The <hi>Matter</hi> of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> Luk. 22.19. Matth. 26.26. 1 Cor. 11.23.24. Mark. 14.25. Matth. 26.29. It is true that it is but carnal matter, and that which is common food among men; but it is more than Bread and Wine by Chriſt's Authority and Appointment, when they are ſet apart by the word of Prayer, and by Faith dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and ſanctified to this uſe and ſervice, in the name, and by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is this Ordinance called the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is called a Supper, becauſe it was inſtituted and celebrated at, or about Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. The Lord Jeſus choſe that time rather than another, as of his Soveraign Authority, will and pleaſure, who may make, appoint, and change times and ſeaſons as he will; ſo likewiſe with reſpect to the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> or the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the time of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was done in the Night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. and alſo that he might aboliſh and put an end to that Ordinance at that time of its obſervation, by ſetting this up in the place and room thereof.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Lords Supper is a <hi>ſeal and pledge</hi> to inchurched Believers alſo. It is not appointed for, and given to them, to be a ſign, token, and memorial of God's Love, and of the Grace and Death of Chriſt only; but to be a ſeal and pledge to them too. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the Ordinance of Circumciſion was a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> that is of Chriſt, the great object of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Circumciſion and the Paſſoever were the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Seals; and Baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are the believing Gentiles Seals. <hi>Seals</hi> are appointed and made uſe of among men to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and confirm their Contracts, Covenants and Promiſes to men, whereby they are made firm and irreverſible. Now the great God, in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the practiſes of men, is pleaſed in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Grace and Mercy, not only to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and promiſe his greateſt mercies to men, but for their ſatisfaction and encouragement, to ſeal them, and thereby to ratifie and confirm them. He need not to have done ſo upon his own account, but he doth it only for our ſakes. Now I judge the Lords Supper Seals thus. (1.) Firſt to the truth and reality of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53333:179"/>and to the Blood of it, namely, Chriſt's, which is called <hi>the Blood of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. and (2.) To the Faith and Conſciences of particular Saints. That is, it ſeals to them their right unto, and intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, the Blood of Chriſt, and to all the benefits of his mediation and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Covenant. But the firſt thing or matter it ſeals to, is the truth and reality of the Covenant on God's part, if I may ſo expreſs it. It pleaſed God to determinate and chuſe to ſave men by Covenant, or in a Covenant-way. And this good pleaſure of his took place in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his eternal Counſels before all time; which Covenant of Grace was made with Jeſus Chriſt in Eternity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. but was made manifeſt in time unto men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. To them he gave <hi>Copies</hi> and <hi>Tranſcripts</hi> of it; at firſt to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Gen. 3.17. and afterwards to <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and others, until the promiſed Seed came, when the whole of it was opened and unfolded. In this Covenant God promiſed to give his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to and for men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1.6. to <hi>make his Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould ſee his Seed,</hi> and of the <hi>travail of his Soul,</hi> and that <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 11. And the Lord Jeſus he engaged to come and fulfil all the will of his Father for them that were given to him. For ſo <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> bring him in ſpeaking of himſelf in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>In Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices for ſin thou hadſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; then ſaid I, Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God; and a Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53333:180"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſpake of him as to come, but <hi>Paul</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and all in purſuance of the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Agreement in Heaven; but I cannot inlarge on this. But I ſay that Chriſt came, and did the Will of his Father by virtue of the eternal Covenant between the Father and Him, as I could ſhew at large, had I room and time to do it. Hence he tells us by <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. that <hi>his delights were with the Sons of men</hi> from the beginning: That <hi>he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to do the Will of him that ſent him:</hi> Joh. 6.38. <hi>That he kept his Fathers Commandments:</hi> Joh. 15.10. That <hi>He finiſhed the work the Father gave him to do,</hi> Joh. 17.4. And appeals to his Father in the caſe, yea, to his Righteouſneſs, and demands of him his promiſed Reward, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, 24. God the Father promiſes to be well pleaſed with him and his Offerings, and in him with thoſe he mediated for: That they ſhould be pardoned, healed, juſtified, waſhed and ſanctified; and that they ſhould be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. That if Chriſt would be <hi>made ſin for them, they ſhould be made Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. ult. Now that God and the Mediatour have ſo Covenanted, promiſed, and engaged for, and in the behalf of Believers; that Chriſt came and finiſhed all the work that the Father gave him to do; that Chriſt hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and ſuffered, the Father ſatisfied and well pleaſed; and that Peace, Friendſhip, and Reconciliation for men is obtained; and that <hi>God is faithful, who hath promiſed;</hi> Heb. 10.23. and that he will not fail <hi>to perform the Truth to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and Mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. ult, is continued and ratified unto Believers, in and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53333:180"/>by the Lord's Supper. For there is held forth a clear proof and confirmation of it. <hi>This is my body that is broken, and my blood that is ſhed or given,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25. Theſe are the firſt objects and matters our faith eyes and fixes on in the Lord's Supper; and theſe are the firſt things that it ſeals unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us, namely, that God hath covenanted and promiſed theſe mercies upon Chriſt's dying; that Chriſt hath dyed, done the Fathers whole will, and finiſhed his work; and that God the Father hath accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Mediation in our behalf, juſtified his Son Jeſus, and is well-pleaſed with him, and with us in him; that God is faithful who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that he is able, and will perform his promiſes, made to Chriſt for, and given down to us. On theſe things our faith muſt fix; and then this Ordinance of the Supper will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Lord's Supper ſeals, or ratifies and confirms to our faith the truth, and reality of the Covenant and promiſes, the death of Chriſt, the faithfulneſs of God, and his being ſatisfied and well pleaſed with Chriſt's mediation for us, and that he will perform his Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto the Heirs of promiſe: <hi>ſo it ſeals, ratifies and confirms Believers intereſt and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them.</hi> It ratifies and confirms to their own Conſciences, that they are intereſted in Chriſt: that they are Chriſts, and Chriſt is theirs: that they are regenerated and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that their ſins are pardoned, and their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accepted in the Beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6, 7. This Ordinance ſeals to them the fruits of Chriſt's death, and to the truth, ſincerity and peculiarity
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53333:181"/>of his grace in them: that they are united to him, and that he is their head, and they are his Members. That he loves them, and they love him, with ſpecial and peculiar love. This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ſeals to them their Adoption, and their right unto the eternal Inheritance: and it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them (as a means of Chriſt's appointing for that end) that God is their Father, and they are his Children: that Chriſt is their Husband, and they are his Spouſes; and that they ſhall live and reign with him in glory.</p>
               <p>But yet know, that though there be a kind of a natural aptneſs in this holy Ordinance, thus to seal the love of God to you, as it is Chriſts Ordinance, and inſtituted by him for this end: yet it cannot, doth not do it of, or by its ſelf, or its own power; <hi>but it ſeals as an Ordinance in the hand of the ſpirit,</hi> or as a fit medium and means, whereby and wherewith the holy ſpirit ſeals the Souls of Believers. It is the proper work of the holy Ghoſt to ſeal, ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his own work in Believers hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. And this great work he doth, eſpecially, in and by the Lord's Supper on the hearts of good men. For as the matters he ſeals to, are his own works in their hearts; ſo he onely can confirm them to their Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. The love of God is ſaid to be <hi>ſhed abroad into our hearts by him,</hi> Rom. 5.5. and to this he ſets his ſeal, and gives in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> Rom. 8.16. namely, that he hath ſhed abroad the love of God in our hearts: that God loves us, &amp; we love him with ſpecial love; and that he hath <hi>begotten us again unto a lively hope by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:53333:181"/>1 Pet. 1.2. He firſt <hi>writes his Lawes,</hi> and creates his grace in our hearts, puts the Lord Jeſus into the poſſeſſion of them, forms ſaith, Repentance and all other graces of Chriſt in them; and then he ſeals, ratifies and confirms all to us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Job.</hi> 33.16. So that now <hi>we know, that we are paſſed from death to life,</hi> Joh. 3.14. and are ſure that we are of God; that the Lord Jeſus is ours, and we are his, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. And can ſay with <hi>Thomas, my Lord and my God;</hi> and with <hi>David, I am thine;</hi> and with <hi>Paul</hi> and others; <hi>if our earthly houſe be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. Thus you ſee how this Ordinance ſeals up the love of God, and the work of his grace in our Souls: And therefore, when ever you receive it, be ſure to look for, and expect it; and make uſe of it for, though not only for this end and purpoſe: And in order thereunto, be careful and diligent, in preparing and fitting your ſelves for the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſeal on your hearts; and then you need not doubt of your obtainment of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Ordinance is inſtituted and given to inchurched Saints, <hi>to bring the Lord Jeſus and them together, into the neareſt, cleareſt, and cloſeſt fellowſhip and communion, that can be in this lower ſtate.</hi> The Lord Jeſus and they do greatly love one another, and delight in communion with each other, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.

They do greatly love, and rejoyce in one anothers company and Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their ſpeeches

There is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fondneſs, and a heart-raviſhing friendlineſs between Chriſt and his Beloved: they lye deep in each others hearts and are ſo knit to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in warm affections, as that they cannot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently bear each others abſence Hence we find the Lord Jeſus and his people inviting one another, and importunately ſolliciting each other to come to them: yea, and proffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and (as it were) inviting or preſſing themſelves upon, or into one anothers company, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore hath glorious Jeſus inſtituted Churches, and gathered up his people into ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual houſholds; formed them into holy Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and made them his walled Gardens.

The Lord Jeſus comes, and tells them ſo, Chap. 5.1. <hi>I am come into my Garden my Siſter, my Spouſe, I have gathered my myrrh with my Spice:</hi> then he chears them up, and bids them welcome, be merry, and eat and drink, not ſparingly, but freely and abundantly, O Beloved.

For this end hath he inſtituted, and for this end ſhould all Church-members receive this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is appointed for Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his inchurched-members, <hi>ſo likewiſe for their Communion among themſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. Good men have heart-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and love-ſeparating luſts, ſelf-Intereſts, world and Devil: and therefore they need all proper means to unite and knit their hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Brotherly Love &amp; Communion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. The Lord Jeſus hath commanded, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged his people <hi>to love one another, as he hath loved them,</hi> Joh. 13.34.

Eph. 5.1, 2. Now in order to the obtainment of it, and that Believers may be encouraged to mind and do his will herein, the Lord Jeſus hath by his own
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53333:183"/>Laws and Authority formed them up into holy Temples, and united them into ſpiritual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and given them occaſion and opportunity to meet together and feaſt themſelves at his Table, at his coſt and charges; and that as Gueſts of his own bidding. There they may often meet, ſit down and feed together of his dainties. There they ſee and taſte, feel and ſmell, and there they may ſpeak of, &amp; hear him, and of his grace and love. There they may ſee, that they are all bought with the ſame price and redeemed with the ſame blood. There they may ſee, that they are members together of the ſame head and body; that they are all <hi>Plants</hi> of his planting; <hi>Trees</hi> of his watering; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſame Grace and Spirit, and the ſame objects of his care and protection.</p>
               <p>There they may ſee, that they are all <hi>bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> and that he hath fellowſhip and communion with them all: That they are <hi>heirs together of the grace of life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. and that they are all entitled to an <hi>eternal inheritance.</hi> There they may ſee, that they are all partakers of the ſame life, and that the Lord Jeſus hath made the ſame proviſions for the everlaſting happineſs of all their Souls. There they may ſee, that they have the <hi>ſame faith and hope,</hi> and that the covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belong to them all: That there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intereſt amongſt them, and that they are concerned in, and with each other: That they are engaged in one common cauſe with Chriſt, and that they are not their own, but one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

               <p>All which things and conſiderations, are of great uſe towards the knitting and endearing of their hearts one to another in ſpiritual love, holy peace, and Brotherly affection. For by their ſitting down altogether as one body, at one Table of the Lord: eating and drinking the ſame Bread and Wine, and by faith, the ſame body and blood of the Lord: by beholding and believing their mutual intereſt in Chriſt, and in all the benefits of his death; and that they are all alike invited to the feaſt, and all alike wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb'd and entertained by their Lord and King: they are much induced thereby to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: to ſeek, deſire and rejoyce in the good of each other, and to walk together as Heirs of the Kingdom of Glory; <hi>keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> And likewiſe, in joyning hearts and hands together, as one body, in celebrating the worſhip, and in magnifying the name and glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An other great uſe and end of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is, <hi>to knit and endear the heart to Chriſt himſelf.</hi> And it is a powerful means to effect it.

But of all means, the Lord's Supper is the moſt full and proper for the opening and repreſenting unto us, unto our faith, the beauty, glory and lovelineſs of Chriſt, in his love and grace: in his death and ſufferings.</p>
               <p>There we may read wonderful Stories, and ſee glorious Myſteries indeed. There we may read and ſee his love and grace to us, ſtreaming forth by his heart blood, and there we may ſee the greatneſs, freeneſs, profitableneſs, purity, ſweetneſs, and the tranſcendant excellency of his love and lovelineſs. There we may ſee the eternal Fountain of love, and the inexhauſtible-Treaſures of his heart, of his grace and kindneſs opened and running down to us; and there we may ſee a bottomleſs Sea of mercies and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions diſcovered. There we may read <hi>Chriſt loving us, and giving himſelf for us, unto an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Gal. 3.13. And Oh! my Brethren, what an attracting, Soul drawing, heart-knitting object of love, is the Lord Jeſus repreſented to be to us, in that Ordinance? It is a Glaſs that repreſents and ſhews us nothing elſe, but love and Chriſts lovelineſs. It is an Ordinance that Preaches and Seals love to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53333:184"/>and thereby provokes, enflames and drawes out their love to him. <hi>Love will be drawn and not driven;</hi> and what drawes it into warm and ſtrong Acts, but lovely perſons, things and actions? love and lovely objects irritates, and drawes forth love to them: and the more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beautiful and glorious they are, the more forceably and powerfuly they draw; as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences ſhews, and we all know.</p>
               <p>But then are ſuch objects and things, moſt attractive and powerful, when they are our own, or when we know that we have a right unto, and an intereſt in them. Now in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, you have theſe glorious objects and things handed out to you, and ſealed to you in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. <hi>Take, cat, this is my body that was broken, and this is my blood that was ſhed for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25. It ſpeaks to ſound-hearted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers thus. Here is your glorious Head and King; your Redeemer and Saviour. Here is the body that was broken, and the blood that was ſhed for you. Here is your Covenant, and here are your promiſes ſealed, ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and here is free, eternal and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and grace, ſhewed and given to you. Oh! how ſtrongly muſt this draw their love, and how powerfully, muſt this enflame their affections to Jeſus Chriſt? For this end it is appointed, and this it doth in meaſure effect in holy hearts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is inſtituted and appointed, <hi>to ſtrengthen and nouriſh inchurched Believers, and to make them fat and flouriſhing in the houſe of God,</hi> Pſal. 92.13, 14. Pſal. 132.13, 14, 15. Pſal. 84.4, 7.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:53333:185"/>
               <p>Believers have many grace-weakning, and heart-waſting-luſts, Snares and Temptations; and therefore they have need of ſuch ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, heart-chearing, and grace-nouriſhing means; that they languiſh not, but thrive and proſper, in the inner man. I have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this before; when I ſhewed you the priviledges of the Churches, and the end for which all Believers ſhould walk in Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: and therefore ſhall not inſiſt on it here. Only let me add, that you may find in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, both <hi>Food and Phyſick.</hi> Here is (as in the hand of an Ordinance) food for your Souls, and nouriſhment for your Graces; and here is Phyſick for them alſo. Here is the bread of Life, and here is the water and wine of Life to; feed and comfort you, to fatten and nouriſh you, to build you up and eſtabliſh you; and to make you ſtrong men in Chriſt: to encourage and help you, and to make you fruitful in every good work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. And here is not only food, but Heavenly and ſpiritual Phyſick too. Here you may have <hi>Purging and cleanſing-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and here you may have comforting and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phyſick alſo.</hi> And you do, and ſtill you will need both. You need Luſts-purging, and Heart-purifying Phyſick: and behold here it is for you. Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf, and ſhed his blood,</hi> that it might purge, cleanſe and heal us, and that it might in, and by his own means, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us; I mean the vertue and efficacy of it, for that end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, 9. Now in this Ordinance, the purging, cleanſing, and heart-purifying virtue of this blood is handed out, and conveyed to the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53333:185"/>Faith of Believers, &amp; which the Spirit in Chriſt's behalf applys, and which we for our ſelves are to apply alſo. The Spirit doth it powerfully and efficaſiouſly, and we by Faith are to do it dutifully, and ſo it obtains its Ends on us: And as it is purging, cleanſing, and heart-purifying Phyſick to our Souls, ſo it is Cordial Phyſick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to refreſh and comfort, to revive and chear our drooping, ſad, and diſconſolate Souls. Of this Blood, and for this End, we may drink free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly! Here we may have our fill, and drink abundantly, according to our needs. Here you may Augment your Light, Faith, Peace, Hope, Joy, Courage, Zeal, Meekneſs, Love, and Patience; and here you may obtain a meaſure of all ſpiritual good. Here you may enrich your Souls with Chriſt, Grace, Aſſurance, Experiences and Conſolations; and here you may obtain the deſtruction of your Luſts. Here you will have the Spirit to feed you with the Bread of Life, and here you may <hi>grow like a Cedar in</hi> Lebanon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13. Therefore make uſe of this Ordinance for this bleſſed End alſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is appointed <hi>to ſhew and repreſent unto us the evil of ſin alſo.</hi> The great God repreſents ſin to us in many glaſſes, and ſhews it in and by ſeveral means. He aſſures us that it is the Evil of Evils, the Plague of Plagues, and that it is the root and fountain, the ſink and ſum of all Miſchiefs; that it is unexpreſſibly and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendantly evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. That it is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his loathing, abhorrence and hatred, as being that which hath turned glorious Angels into hateful Devils, and thrown them out of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53333:186"/>Heaven into Hell; as that which hath defaced and marr'd his Image in men, and made them Enemies unto, and Rebels againſt God. This he declares to us in, and by his Word, his Law and Goſpel; as alſo by the Judgments he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth in the Earth on Sinners; yea, the whole Creation here below do loudly proclaim it. But the cleareſt glaſs wherein God opens and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the odiouſneſs, and exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, is Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, which the Lords Supper plainly declares unto us, and where we may ſee it diſplayed in all its moſt hateful and abominable colours. Here you may by Faith, ſee the exceeding great Evil of it, and be provoked and ſtirred up to Hate, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, to eſchew and avoyd it. For by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Curſe and Wrath of God, poured out on the Soul and Body of his dear Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and by ſeeing him Reproached, Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Contemned, Deſpiſed, Crucified, Hanged, Nailed to the Croſs, Cruelly handled, Tortured, Tormented, Pierced, Murdered, and above all, the weight of divine Vengance preſſing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, and wringing out Bloody Sweats, and he pouring out his Soul to Death, and all for, and under the weight of our Sins and Guilt. Surely the ſight of this, by Faith, will greatly raiſe our hatred of all ſin, and diſſwade us from it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is appointed and given <hi>to encreaſe and ſtrengthen our Goſpel-Repentance too.</hi> Here we may look on Him, whom <hi>we by ſin have pierced, and mourn, and be in bitterneſs of Soul,</hi> Zach. 12.10. for here is the Blood of the <hi>Scape Goat,</hi> that is able to break the moſt ſtony hearts in
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53333:186"/>the world. And we ſtand in daily need of it, for we are in danger every day of <hi>being hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> and the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. But the Lord's Supper preſents to us a heart-melting Object, yea, many ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. There we may ſee heart-melting Love, and there we may behold heart-breaking Grace. There we may perceive the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attonement for our ſins; and there we may underſtand that the Lord of Glory hath taken off from us our Sins, Guilt, and Puniſhment. There we may diſcern him ſtanding in our ſtead, and between the living God and us Condemned dead men, with the <hi>Cenſor of the Sanctuary</hi> full of his precious Blood, making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for us to divine Juſtice. There we may know (in meaſure) how dearly He loved us, and how dear we have coſt. There we may ſee our ſins Pardoned, perſons Accepted, God Reconciled and Well-pleaſed; &amp; there we may hear him ſaying, <hi>Deliver them out of Priſon, for I have found and accepted a Ranſom.</hi> Surely, there is not a more powerful means in the World to produce and provoke to Repentance; yea, pure Goſpel-Repentance in Believers, than the Lord's Supper is. For here are preſented to us all the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Goſpel-motives to unfained, Spiritual and Goſpel-Repentance, to melt &amp; ſoften the heart. It is Love &amp; Grace, the hopes of Pardon and Acceptance, and of being ſanctified and ſaved, that provokes and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Repentance unto Life, not Fear and Dread of Divine Wrath and Vengeance: Not the bare ſight and Conviction of Sin, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of future puniſhment; no, but 'tis
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53333:187"/>the ſenſe or hope (at leaſt) of our perſons being loved and accepted into favour with God, and of our being acquitted and juſtified through the blood of the Covenant that doth it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To ſtir us up to <hi>Admire, Adore, and Praiſe the great and free Love and Grace of God, and Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> They do in and by this Ordinance, ſet off and commend their free, eternal, and diſtinguiſhing Love and Grace unto Believers; and thereby give them occaſion of Praiſing, Admiring, and Adoring it. Theſe are ſome of God's Holy and Gracious Ends in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing this Ordinance for, and giving it unto them; and theſe, and what-ever other uſes and ends there are of it, ſhould be diligently ſought out and underſtood by all Believers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound out, they ſhould be carefully, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and faithfully aimed at and purſued by them.</p>
               <p>Well then, do you joyn Iſſues with God, aim at, and carry on the holy Ends of Jeſus Chriſt in this Goſpel Ordinance; and by your ſo doing, you will pleaſe and honour him, and greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit your own Souls.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the neceſſary qualifications and preparations of all worthy Receivers of the Lords Supper; or what is required of, and ought to be found in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There qualifications and preparations are two-fold. 1. A <hi>State</hi> qualification or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. 2. A <hi>habitual and practical,</hi> or actual fitneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>State</hi>-worthineſs or qualification, which in brief is this, or conſiſts of theſe two things.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53333:187"/>1. <hi>Regeneration.</hi> 2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt by Faith.</hi> (1.) Regeneration, or a <hi>New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. This is abſolutely neceſſary as to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, 5. ſo to fit and qualifie men to, and for every good work. Without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or being Born again, we cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Repent, or Obey the Goſpel in a right and acceptable manner. Without this change of Nature, we cannot love God, nor fear God; we cannot know him rightly, nor worſhip him Spiritually, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. for we cannot Worſhip him with <hi>Reverence and Godly fear,</hi> until we are partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of his ſpecial Grace to do it withal, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 28. In our Unregenerate States, we are <hi>blind and dark,</hi> Eph. 5.8. <hi>Dead in ſins,</hi> Eph. 2.1.5. <hi>Enemies to God, and Strangers to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. We are Carnal and Vain, Hard-hearted and Impenitent Sinners, and are ſhut up in Unbelief: Yea, we are Haters of God, and the power of Godlineſs, and exceſſive Lovers of Sin and the World, and altogether voyd of the Love of God, and of real love and pitty to our own Souls. Now then, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that we be Regenerated and <hi>Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. for till then we are utterly uncapable of doing them according to the Will of God. How then can we receive and partake of the Lords Supper worthily, until we are Regenerated and made New Creatures? How can we <hi>diſcern the Lords Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. and how can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the myſtery, and take in the profit of Chriſt, his Death to our Souls, until we are
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53333:188"/>taught of God? How can we receive it in Faith, and in Obedience to his Will, until the Grace of Faith be formed in our hearts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our hearts are bowed and melted by Grace into the Holy Will of God? How can we Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and Celebrate this Ordinance with lively hearts, whilſt we are dead in ſins? And how can we apply the Seal to that Grace which we have not? Therefore I ſay it is abſolutely neceſſary that all that receive this holy Seal, be Regenerated and made New Creatures. For how can that Ordinance feed and nouriſh that which is not in Being, namely, the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith</hi> alſo. They muſt be in him, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, as living Members to their Head, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. Chriſt muſt be theirs, and they muſt be his by Faith, or they cannot claim him as theirs, nor receive any benefit by his Death; for elſe, how can they joyn with Chriſt in his ſaying, <hi>Take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24. But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt have an <hi>habitual worthineſs or meetneſs</hi> for the right Receiving, and due Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Ordinance likewiſe: I mean a <hi>holy and ſpiritual, ready and accurate frame and diſpoſition</hi> of heart to, &amp; for it; they muſt have their Sight, Faith, and Love ready in act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, or they are not, cannot be meet partakers of the Lord's Table. It is not only neceſſary that they be in a State of Juſtification and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but they muſt be alſo in, or qualified with a habitual frame, poſture, and diſpoſition
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53333:188"/>of heart, to receive and celebrate it to the Glory of Chriſt, and profit of their own Souls, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. Their Hearts and Graces muſt be ready fixed and tuned for the work, that they be not to ſeek of them, or at a loſs concerning them, when they ſhould honour Chriſt with, and get the Seal of the Spirit to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. This habitual meetneſs or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, qualification, or preparation, (call it which you will) is a matter of great weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially in this matter, and therefore you muſt labour all you can to obtain it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>practical and actual meetneſs</hi> and preparedneſs for the worthy and acceptable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lords Supper alſo. That is, there is ſomething (more than ordinary) to be done by them in order to their worthy participating of it. This practical preparation I ſhall briefly preſent to you in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt <hi>examine your ſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of the Bread, and drink of the Cup.</hi> And here 1. You muſt examine your <hi>States,</hi> and try if you be in the Faith or no: If you are indeed, (at leaſt in a well grounded hope and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a juſtified and regenerate ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. and to know whether the Lord Jeſus and his ſpecial Grace be formed in your hearts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. This muſt be effectually done by you, or you may be undone, <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own Damnation,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. And if you ſhould eat and drink this holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in an unregenerate and unjuſtified ſtate; be you ſure, that you will eat and drink dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53333:189"/>to your ſelves; for the Lord hath ſpoken it. This is not a matter to be dallied with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examine your ſelves, if you allow not of ſome ſin, and if there be not one luſt, carnal-ſelf, or ſome one or more Idols indulged, and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in at, and by you. For ſhould you careleſly overlook this matter, and ſit down at the <hi>Kings Table</hi> with any of them in you, and wink at it: be you aſſured, that the Lord Jeſus will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and bleſs you: viſit you and ſmile on your Souls; but he will loath your offering, and hide his face from your Souls. Therefore ſearch and ſee what you can find of any of them in your hearts or hands; within or without you. For your great Lord <hi>ſearches and tryes you,</hi> Rev. 2.23. Make an impartial, and diligent enquiry into this matter, and that with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible integrity of heart, that God may ſee, that you are willing to know the worſt of your ſelves. And do as <hi>David</hi> and others have done, in this weighty matter, Pſal. 77.6. <hi>make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch,</hi> and entreat the Lord to help you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>ult.</hi> Ask your ſelves, and try to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; do I not wink at and practically allow of Anger, Paſſion, Wrath; yea, of Haſtineſs, Raſhneſs, Peeviſhneſs and Frowardneſs? Do not I wink at my Pride, worldly-mindedneſs, vanity of mind, and frothy diſcourſes? Do not I hearken to <hi>Tatlers,</hi> and take up Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt the Righteous, and do not I Reproach them alſo, by telling to others what I hear? Do not I worſhip God carnally, and in a formal and Hypocritical manner; and do not I live in the careleſs neglect of many Religious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative duties; day after day? Am not I a <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:53333:189"/>among my Relations and others, by a peeviſh and quarrelſome Spirit, inſtead of a Peace-maker? Am I not guilty of very much luke-warmneſs and indifferency of ſpirit in all Duties, as alſo of much idleneſs and miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pretious time? Do I not live as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to God, and his holy will; and in an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with my ſelf; and do not I ſlight my Goſpel-mercies, and undervalue the good things that God gives me? Do I not leave my eternal concerns in doubt and at a great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and live year after year in the dark, about my ſpiritual ſtate? although I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means to enable me to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; and am enjoyned ſo to do, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Examine</hi> your ſelves, and try if you do act and move in duties by the Spirit of God; with, and from <hi>Divine and Goſpel principles?</hi> Doth the life of Chriſt animate and quicken you, the love of Chriſt conſtrain and draw you; the light of Chriſt lead and conduct you; and the faith of Chriſt ſtrengthen and encourage your hearts in them? Do you act and worſhip God with your own Spirit, or the holy Spirit of God? And do you worſhip him with ſpecial light, love, faith, and ſincerity, or with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? For it is poſſible you may be miſtaken, and take the one for the other. So likewiſe you ſhould examine your <hi>Aims and Ends;</hi> what you Intend and Deſign in receiving of the Lords Supper? And you muſt alſo enquire what <hi>Earnings and Improvements</hi> you make of it, and what your Spiritual profit is? what you meet withall in it, and what good you receive from it?</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:53333:190"/>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever Evil you find in your Hearts or Hands; <hi>you muſt throw out, and Repent of it.</hi> You muſt not think it enough, and that your Work is done, when you have found out the <hi>Plagues of your own Hearts,</hi> 1 Kings 8.38. But you muſt endeavour the ſpeedy removal of them, <hi>and thorowly amend your Wayes,</hi> Jer. 7.3, 5. You muſt confeſs them to God unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, humble your ſelves; <hi>and Repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Job. 42.6. 2 Chro. 7.14. yea, you muſt alſo Hate and Abhor them, forſake and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them; and reſolve to have no more to do with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You muſt alſo prepare your ſelves, by <hi>emptying the Heart of Carnal-ſelf, and the World:</hi> for elſe theſe things will greatly Obſtruct your Holy and Profitable receiving of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The more the Heart is emptied, the more it will Hunger and Thirſt after it, and the good and profit of it: the ſtronger your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires will be after Chriſt, and the benefits of his Death, the clearer you will ſee them, and the Sweeter they will be unto your Taſte. The emptier you are of theſe Heart ſuffocating Evils, the more Deſirable, Beautiful, Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Pleaſant they will be unto your Souls; and the greater and more apparant, will your Earnings and Advantages be to your Souls. As you will abundantly Experience, if you make proof of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Prepare for the Worthy and Profitable receiving of this Holy and Soul enriching Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; by <hi>poſſeſſing your Hearts with the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Goodneſs, the Priviledge and Profit of it.</hi> Get as clear Apprehenſions and Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53333:190"/>as you can, of the Perſon, the Love, Grace and Benefits, it holds forth unto you, and who it is you go to meet withall there. For the clearer your ſight is of theſe things, and the more the Heart is poſſeſſed and affected with them, the more they will ſtir up and provoke your Faith, enflame your Love, and draw your Hearts to them. The clearer they lye in your Heads, (your Minds) and the warmer they lye on your Hearts, the more Influential and forceable they will be on all your Affections and Graces, to quicken, raiſe and draw them forth into act and Exerciſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Prepare, by <hi>getting a due ſight and ſenſe of your own Wants and Weakneſs: your own perſonal Vileneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs, and of your own Sins and Iniquities.</hi> That the due ſight and ſenſe of theſe Evils, may make you Vile in your own Eyes, debaſe and humble your Hearts. That you may be truly Baſe and Vile in your own Eyes, and draw nigh to him with a <hi>Holy fear and Trembling,</hi> Eſa. 66.2. Pſal. 2.11. That you may go to him, and make uſe of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, for the ſupply of your Wants, and ſtrengthening your Weakneſſes, and that you may be ſenſible of the worth and neceſſity of Chriſt's Death for you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Get high and great Expectations, raiſed in your Hearts, of ſeeing, enjoying and receiving a meaſure of all the fulneſs of Chriſt, and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or the fruits of his Death.</hi> The Lord Jeſus will be moſt free and open handed there, to all worthy Receivers: and therefore, you muſt not go to it, and him, with dejected, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and low Spirits and Hopes. But you muſt

Be ſure, that he would have you do ſo, that it is your Duty, and that you ſhall find him a liberal and noble Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to you.

               </head>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>WHether a Church-member may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw or abſent himſelf from the Lord's Supper, upon any Sin, or Offence given him, by one or more of his Fellow-members in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The offended Member may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, nor by any means abſent himſelf on that Account. Too many indeed are apt to think, (and they Act accordingly) that they have a Diſpenſation to neglect their Duty, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to ſlight their Priviledge, becauſe others are not ſo good as they ſhould be, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them Offence. But that which gives them ſuch a Diſpenſation, is their own Pride, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Prejudice and wilfulneſs, not Jeſus Chriſt their Head. But I ſay, you may not abſent your ſelves, or neglect that great Ordinance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Accounts. (1) Becauſe it is your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to receive it, and wait on Chriſt in it, (as
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53333:191"/>hath been ſhewed) and it is not anothers Sin, that can diſcharge you of your Duty. (2) If thy Brother hath ſinned, and thereby incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf for a worthy receiving and celebrating of this holy Ordinance; thou haſt the greater Reaſon offered thee, to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it worthily to the honour of Chriſt. For it is moſt unreaſonable, that he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Glory of his Grace, and thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe thy Brother hath ſinned againſt him, and diſhonoured him already. (3) Haſt thou rebuked thy ſinning Brother, and laboured to bring him to Repentance? and art thou mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and praying for him, and waiting on God for his Recovery, as thou art bound to do? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. Why! then his Sin ſhall not be laid to thy Charge; neither may it impede or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Reception of this Ordinance. (4) It is thy Prejudice and Wrath againſt, if not thy Loathing and Hating of the offending Perſon, that cauſes thy Neglect, or the Guilt thou haſt contracted to thy own Soul and Conſcience, that makes thee forbear coming to the Lord's Table, and not a dutiful and conſcientious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, becauſe God would have it ſo. For it is contrary to his holy Will. (5) Allow of this, and you will never want occaſions, but the Devil and your own Luſts will ſtill ſupply you with enough, to provoke and perſwade you to a total neglect of this Duty.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Suppoſe I find my ſelf unfit and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive the Lord's Supper, may not I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: for thy waiting on Chriſt at his Table is thy Duty, as hath been proved. And
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53333:192"/>therefore thou maiſt not think of neglecting it; but the more unfit and indiſpoſed thou findeſt thy ſelf to be, the more ſeriouſly, diligently and vigorouſly thou ſhouldſt labour to prepare thy ſelf, and get the removal of thy Indiſpoſitions: To obtain and put on the <hi>Wedding-Garment,</hi> that thou maiſt worthily partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>If the Iron be blunt; the harder you muſt ſtrike,</hi> Eccl. 10 10. The more unprepared you are, the more and greater diligence you muſt uſe to prepare. I know that Church-members are ſubject to this Temptation, which if yielded to, will bring on many Miſchiefs upon their Souls, as ſome have ſadly experienced. But what hinders, that you endeavour not the removal of theſe Evils preſently? you may not alwayes live ſo, but one time or other you muſt get rid of them, unleſs you will periſh. And when will you find a fitter time for the doing of it, than now? Therefore know, that you have two great and indiſpenſible Duties lying before you. 1. To uſe all means for the removing all Obſtructions, and to get your Hearts in a ready meet poſture for God and your Duties, <hi>Amos,</hi> 4.12. (2) To wait on Chriſt at his Table on the next opportunity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.28. and not to add Sin to Sin by neglecting either of them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What do you think of thoſe Members, who do wilfully neglect to come to the Lord's Table very often, and for a long time together? or of ſuch as will ride out of Town ſuch dayes, as they are called to partake of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, either they are dead rotten Members, ſuch as are mentioned in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53333:192"/>elſe they have fouly back ſliden from God, and contracted much guilt and hardneſs of Heart. You may be ſure that matters go very ill with them at home, and that they are in a withering and dying condition: that they have wickedly forſaken God, and God hath forſaken them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. They have moſt horribly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, grieved the holy Spirit, and alienated their Hearts from God. They have loſt the ſavour of Chriſt, that was on their Hearts, the Conſcience of, and love to their Duties, all care of, and reſpect to their own and their Brethren's Souls; and have with <hi>Ephraim, caſt off the thing that is good; and therefore Evil purſues them,</hi> Hoſea. 8.3. and they are under the Temptations of the Devil. For were it not thus with them, they could not, durſt not do as they do in this great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter. The ſight of their Duty, the ſenſe of their own wants, and their love to Chriſt, their Brethren and their own Souls, would in no wiſe permit, or diſpenſe with ſuch wilful neglects of ſo great a Duty and Priviledge, and to keep at a diſtance from their God. And if you mind them, and have cloſe diſcourſe with them about ſpiritual things, you may find them neglecters and ſlighters of other Duties; of Carnal, Vain, Sottiſh and Stupid Spirits; and that their Hearts and Souls are in a ſad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition. They deſire not, care not for your Company, nor to hear you talk with them about their Soul's concernments. And if they pretend any excuſe, or offer to defend their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>glects; be ſure they will caſt all, or moſt of the blame or cauſe off from themſelves on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53333:193"/>which argues a vile wicked Spirit. They neglect the Lord's Table, not becauſe their own Hearts &amp; Wayes are very evil and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (if any will believe them) no; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Miniſtry, the Church, or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Members of it are not good enough for their Communion. And herein they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme or ſcandalize them, and offer violence to their own Conſciences, for the clearing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in belying their Teacher or Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not Excommunication an Ordinance of Chriſt in his Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, it is a great and uſeful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which may not be neglected, when need requires, on any pretence whatſoever; becauſe the Lord Jeſus, the King and Head of his Churches hath inſtituted and commanded it to be done; and hath thereby made it their indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5, 11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>For what ends muſt the Church uſe this Ordinance? and why hath Chriſt appointed it, and commanded the Adminiſtration of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For theſe Six ends, 1. To remove Offence from the Church. For a ſcandalous Member continuing in his Impenitency is a Stumbling-block to them. 2. The healing of the Offender, by bringing him to deep Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sin, and Repentance for it: to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him, to cauſe him to own and acknowledge his Sin, and amend his Wayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. 3. To clear the Church of the guilt of his Sin. For if they neglect their Duty, and ſo practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally wink at his Sin, they involve themſelves
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53333:193"/>in the guilt of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. 4. To caution others, and cauſe them to hear and fear, and do not ſo wickedly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12, 13. 5. To free the Church from Reproach and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal from without; for their Enemies will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly defame them, if they hear that they ſuffer viſible Tranſgreſſors among them. 6. To <hi>purge out the Leaven, that the Church may be a pure Lump;</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. <hi>and a holy Habitation of God,</hi> Eph. 2.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When muſt this Ordinance be uſed in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Only in caſe of neceſſity, when other means will not convince and bring Offenders to ſerious and hearty Repentance, prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the other Evils, or obtain the Ends before mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is Excommunication?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the cutting off a Church-member from his Memberſhip with the Church, putting him out of their Communion and Society, and ſhutting him out from the enjoyment of all Church-Priviledges, &amp; putting him into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdom: <hi>or to deliver him to Satan, in the name of Chriſt, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that his Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. It is variouſly expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the fore-quoted Texts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not Excommunication an high Act of Cruelty, and too great Severity for a Church to uſe towards their Follow-members?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. For it is one of Chriſt's healing <hi>Medicines,</hi> wherewith he cures Souls, and one of his ſoveraign Means whereby he ſets broken
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53333:194"/>bones in joynt. The loving, kind and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Head and Father of his People hath not ſuch a heart towards them, neither hath he ſhewed any Cruelty or undue Severity towards them in his appointing this Ordinance for his Churches, and requiring the Execution of it on obſtinate Tranſgreſſors for their Health &amp; Cure. 2. The executing of this healing Ordinance on ſuch, is ſo far from being an Act of Cruelty, as that it is one of the higheſt Acts of our Love, Favour and Kindneſs to their Souls; and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neglect of it, is one of the higheſt Acts of Cruelty, that we can ſhew them. For to let a Brother alone in his Sin and known Wickedneſs, ſee him in the Ditch and leave him there: knowing him dropping into Hell, and not uſe the means the Lord hath given us, for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him out, and preventing of his eternal Ruine, is ſuch a piece of Cruelty and horrible Injuſtice, as that there can hardly be greater found among men. If it be Cruelty in me to uſe the Lords means for ſaving of my Brother's Soul, then let it be ſo called and accounted, not elſe. And great is their ſimple Ignorance, or wilful Blindneſs, who think and talk after this rate; and too many of them, are found in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But for what ſins ſhould this Ordinance be adminiſtred to, or executed on Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For any ſins that are not unavoydable Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, if perſiſted in, &amp; the Offenders reject or neglect to hear, receive, and improve Reproofs, to their Conviction, Sorrow, and Amendment; to their deep Humiliation, Confeſſion and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53333:194"/>Acknowledgment. The Lord Jeſus hath not told us in particular, for what ſins Offenders ſhould be Excommunicated out of the Church; but tells us in <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th</hi> 18.15. <hi>that if thy Brother ſin againſt thee:</hi> He names not the particular ſin or ſins; but that expreſſion implys any ſin, that is not an unavoydable infirmity in him: And mark it, It is not the matter of the ſin that is ſo much to be minded, as the manner of ſinning, and the Circumſtances wherewith it is attended. As 1. If a ſin that is generally known among Profeſſors of the Goſpel, and owned to be a ſin, and which the Sinner cannot be ignorant of, eſpecially when it is laid before him, and opened to him by the Reprover. (2.) VVilfully or careleſly committed. (3.) If it be a ſcandalous ſin, and pernitious to God or Men. (4.) If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon deliberation. (5.) VVith heat and fervour of ſpirit. (6.) If committed after Conviction of the Evil of it, and Repentance for it. (7.) If it be perſiſted in after Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Offender ſhall ſlight or neglect Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Reproof under it, and ſhall contemn the firſt and ſecond Admonition turning a deaf ear to it; or ſhall not repent and give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the wrong he hath done by his ſin; I ſay, let the matter of the ſin be what it will, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome, or all theſe Circumſtances and Aggravations; the Church may by Chriſt's Authority proceed againſt him, and cut him off. To name ſome few of the many ſins, which if not repented of, but perſiſted in, which they may be judged to do, until they manifeſt open Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. (1) Strong &amp; violent Paſſions. (2.) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Wrath, Envy, Bitterneſs, and Anger
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53333:195"/>ſhewed without great provocation. (3.) Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Frowardneſs, Peeviſhneſs, Clamour, &amp; Strife. (4.) Jangling, Diſputing, &amp; Peace-breakings, &amp; all things that directly tend to hinder the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Peace of the Church. (5.) Back-bitings, and ſpeaking evil againſt, or of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. (6.) Conſtant or frequent neglects of Family and Church-duties, and the Ordinances of God in them. (7.) Needleſs Aſſociating and holding Communion with profane and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons. (8.) Defrauding any perſons of their juſt dues any way, on any account whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when it might have been prevented. (9.) Diſobedience to the Lawful Commands and Rules of Parents, Maſters, Magiſtrates, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or any other that have Authority over them. (10.) Publiſhing falſe Doctrines againſt the Fundamentals of the Goſpel, Faith, and Worſhip. (11.) Falſe Accuſing any Perſons, eſpecially any of the Church. (12.) Railing at, or reviling others to their face, or behind their backs. (13.) Idleneſs, Tatling, and being Buſie-bodies in other mens matters that concern them not. Theſe, and many more of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, are ſuch apparent ſins, as that Church-members cannot be ſuppoſed to be ignorant of them, and they are very offenſive Evils to God and men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So likewiſe is wilful deſerting and cauſeleſs leaving of a Church at their own will and pleaſure, and thereby have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Covenant of God. I have not room to enlarge on theſe brief hints of this matter; but I could otherwiſe ſay much more for the clearing and confirming of it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>May Churches keep out ſuch perſons as offer themſelves to joyn with them, at their own will and pleaſure, without apparent cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:53333:195"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, they may not; for 1. We have no diſpenſation to do ſo, but are bid <hi>to receive them,</hi> Rom. 14.1. Rom. 15.7. (2.) The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches did receive perſons, as ſoon as they proffered to joyn with them, unleſs they had any juſt cauſe to deny them; and what they did therein, was by Apoſtolical direction. (3.) By refuſing to accept them into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>ſpeedily</hi> (without juſt cauſe) they do greatly wrong and injure them, and grieve ſuch as the Lord would not have grieved. (1.) They keep them out of their Right, and detain from them their juſt dues; they deprive them of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which Chriſt hath bought for them. And (2,) Lay them under many and great Temptations to ſin and deſpond. (4.) They rob God of his Honour and Glory, which he might receive from them in their Church-duties. (5.) They diſcourage perſons from coming to, and joyning with them, and ſo expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ruine. For the Churches cannot long ſubſiſt without continual additions of new Members, becauſe death is ſtill fetching away, and pulling out of the old. (6.) They do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to reproach and juſt cenſure by ſuch wilful neglects towards them. (7.) Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, they may be either received or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in one week, as well as in three months, did all mind and attend to their duty in their place in the Churches. Take heed that this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be not found in or among you; for aſſuredly it is a foul Iniquity to rob God, wrong Souls, and injure the Church; to grieve the hearts of the Godly, and tempt them to ſin; which Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity you are guilty of, who by your negligence
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53333:196"/>or prejudice do keep them from Church. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, who deſire to partake of them with you, longer than of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>May not Paſtors leave their Churches upon any account whatſoever?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doubtleſs God may, and ſomtimes he doth providentially call them off, and they ought to follow it. For (1.) There is not any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt enjoyning them to ſtay with them all their days. (2.) Chriſt tells them, that <hi>if they be perſecuted in one City, they may fly to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Matth. 10.23. But they may not leave them, no, not with the Churches conſent and approbation, but upon ſome extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and Calls of God. For as Chriſt their Maſter ſent them there, and they were ſetled there by him, as the great Agent and Doer of it, to do his work, and miniſter in his Name, and by his Authority, with his Gifts &amp; Bleſſing; ſo the Churches have nothing to do to diſmiſs and give them liberty to depart without the good leave and conſent of Chriſt himſelf, who ſent and ſet them in and among them. And therefore their leaving of the Churches, and the Churche; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing of them, is not their own act, but in and by the order and commiſſion of Chriſt. What they do therein, muſt be only in, from, and by the Will and Pleaſure of their Head and King, and not from their own. For without Warrant from him, the Churches have no power to leave their Paſtors, nor their Paſtors them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When, or upon what accounts may Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors leave their Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſ.</hi> Firſt, when they are ſeverely perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their Enemies level their fiery Darts,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53333:196"/>and ſhoot their Arrows of malice againſt their Perſons and Families, and perſiſt in their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo as that there is no probable way to eſcape them, but in all probability they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by them. In this caſe, the Lord Jeſus, the Apoſtles, and the Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fled and went their way; and hereby the Lord doth often call off Paſtors now. (2.) In caſe the Churches leave them, and will not ſtand by them. (3.) In caſe their Churches fall into Rents &amp; Schiſms, and they grow ſo head-ſtrong and unruly, as that they can do no good upon them, as ſomtimes it falls out. (4.) In caſe they cannot live and ſubſiſt with and by them, but in a miſerable and diſtreſſed condition. For if the Churches provide not for them, and they have not otherwiſe a ſubſiſtance, they are not bound to provide for their Churches. For <hi>God hath ordained, that they, that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.14. and they muſt live by Bread, and provide for their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>or they deny the Faith, and are worſe than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8. (5.) In caſe the Lord doth open a door for their Miniſtry elſe-where, which is always to be obſerved in this matter. If Providence invite them elſe-where to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to a People that they knew not of, and ſought not after, but the hand of Providence preſented it to them (as it were) accidentally, and are by that ſtrange people (as to them) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to preach to, and take the care of them; and ſo they lay not down their work, but follow it in thoſe other places, where in all probability they may do Chriſt and Souls greater Service, and not expoſe themſelves thereby to thoſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53333:197"/>Straits and Temptations to ſin, they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I ſay, take in this caſe with any of the other, &amp; I am ſatisfied their Call is clear to leave their Churches.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>May Church-members leave their Churches at their own will and pleaſure, and go elſe-where when they pleaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, they may not: They muſt not leave them, unleſs by ſome extraordinary hand of Providence the Lord calls them off, to walk with another people. If by Perſecution or by Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or by the command of their Parents, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or Maſters, or other Superiours, they are called off, they may go with the Churches conſent, as likewiſe in other weighty caſes. But they may not go from them at their own will and pleaſure, to gratifie their Pride, Prejudice, and to pleaſe their own fickle minds and itching ears, or upon any ordinary account whatſoever; and that for theſe reaſons, (1.) The Lord char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them not to forſake their Churches, nor holding Communion and Fellowſhip with them in the Ordinances and Worſhip of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. (2.) He brands them, and ſets a black mark of Ignonimy on all wilful and cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Deſerters of Churches, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26. <hi>as the manner of ſome is,</hi> which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous expreſſion of them, who forſake their Church-memberſhip, and their places, work and duty there. (3.) Deſerters of their Church-memberſhip at their own will and pleaſure do make the Churches thereby to be like <hi>Inns or Ale-houſes,</hi> where perſons go in and out at their own will and pleaſure. Such as do ſo in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and civil Societies, are accounted vile, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53333:197"/>and extravagant perſons, becauſe they live not under good Laws, nor walk by the good Rules and Orders of the Society. How much more vile and lawleſs are Church-members, who have <hi>given up themſelves in a profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. and engaged to walk as Church-members, and yet ſhall walk, act, and go in and out, as lawleſs perſons, who owe no ſubjection to Chriſt, nor to his Laws and Authority in the Church? (4.) Wilful Deſerters of Churches, are notorious Covenant-breakers alſo. When they gave the right hand of Fellowſhip, and were received into the Church, they ſolemnly promiſed to walk with God in the Church, hold Communion with it, ſubject unto, and live under the Government and according to the Laws thereof, until God ſhould by ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Providence call them off: Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they call off themſelves, and they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by practically contemn and trample on their ſolemn Engagement, as well as on the Laws, Orders and Government of Chriſt. (5) Their cauſeleſs and wilful departure from and leaving of a Church, to which they were joyned, is very reproachful and ſcandalous to the Church. For by their ſo forſaking of it, they declare that they are too good, and the Church is too bad for their Communion. They caſt dirt on the Church and the Miniſtry of Chriſt therein with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and manifeſt that either themſelves, or the Church and the Miniſtry there, are very vile and wicked: Or elſe why did they leave and forſake them? It was either for their Goodneſs or Wickedneſs. Not for their Goodneſs in their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53333:198"/>account, for ſhould they pretend to leave them for their Goodneſs, they will thereby lay open their own Hypocryſie and Profaneſs to all men, and be ſure that they will not do in words at leaſt. Why then, what follows, but that the cauſe of their departure is the Churches and their Miniſters Wickedneſs or Unworthineſs? Thus they will do, and care not what miſchief they do unto the Church, ſo they may but ſave ſtakes and gratifie their own Luſts. (6) Such Deſerters of Churches are Church-deſtroyers: they fight againſt God, and pull down that which he builds up. God puts in and faſtens ſtones, and they pull them out. He ſets up and forms holy Temples for himſelf to dwell in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> and they break them down, or deface and marr them at leaſt. What Churches can ſtand in order, from and beauty, if the Members of them may do what they pleaſe, and go in and out when they will? (7) By ſuch departures from their Churches they cut off and caſt out themſelves from the People of God, his Worſhip and Ordinances, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Devils Kingdom again. For they may not, ought not to be accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into any of the Churches of Chriſt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, becauſe they are diſorderly walkers, and are under the blot of ſcanda ous perſons, of lawleſs and diſobedient Members. (8) They may not depart, becauſe of the juſt occaſion of Offence, Grief and Trouble, that they will give the Church thereby; excepting in extraordinary caſes, or are neceſſitated by ſtaying and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with the Church to partake with them in Sin. And it is remarkable, how
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53333:198"/>God hath declared his abhorrence of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures by the Judgments, that have followed ſuch as have been guilty of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally my Brethren;</hi> let us all mind and <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another,</hi> Rom. 14.19. Let us in all our doings and procedures, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> and endeavour to know the will of God, walk by his Laws, conform to, be ruled by, and practiſe the <hi>holy and perfect will of our glorious Head, &amp; ſoveraign Lord and King,</hi> Joh. 14.15. Joh. 15.10. Rom. 12.1, 2. Eph. 6.6. Joh. 14.21, 23. 1 Joh. 5.2, 3. Let us never adventure on any actions or things, until we have a Divine Warrant for it, and when we have that in our eye, let us proceed with all our might, doing that which is the Will of God, and that becauſe it is his Will. For then we may, and ſhall be able to do our works comfortably. Then we ſhall do them as the holy Will of God in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Command and Authority. Then ſhall we pleaſe and honour our Head and King, and by Faith and Hope look for, and expect his free and gracious Acceptance, and his promiſed Aſſiſtance; as alſo a great Reward in this life and that which is to come. Then you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently expect, and chearfully look for Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with God in all your ways and Duties, when in your places and ſtations, you are really obſerving and doing the holy and perfect Will of God, and not your own.</p>
